    <h2><a name="INTRODUCTION"
       id="INTRODUCTION"></a> INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p>The Bible is one of the two or three oldest books in the
    world, but unlike most of the ancient books, it is found not
    only in great libraries, but in almost every home of the
    civilized world; and it is not only studied by learned
    scholars, but read by the common people; and its many stories
    grasp and hold the attention of little children. Happy is that
    child who has heard, over and over again, the Bible stories
    until they have become fixed in his mind and memory, to become
    the foundations of a noble life.</p>

       id="THE_STORY_OF_ADAM_AND_EVE"></a>THE STORY OF ADAM AND
       EVE</h2>

    <p>The first man's name was Adam and his wife he called Eve.
    They lived in a beautiful Garden away in the East Country which
    was called Eden, filled with beautiful trees and flowers of all
    kinds. But they did not live in Eden long for they did not obey
    God's command, but ate the fruit of a tree which had been
    forbidden them. They were driven forth by an angel and had to
    give up their beautiful home.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="THEY_WERE_DRIVEN_FORTH_BY_AN_ANGEL"
             id="THEY_WERE_DRIVEN_FORTH_BY_AN_ANGEL"><img src="./images/figure3_th.jpg"
             title="They were driven forth by an angel"
             alt="They were driven forth by an angel" /></a><br />
        <i>They were driven forth by an angel</i>
    </div>

    <p>So Adam and his wife went out into the world to live and to
    work. For a time they were all alone, but after a while God
    gave them a little child of their own, <a name="Page_11"
       id="Page_11"></a>the first baby that ever came into the
       world. Eve named him Cain; and after a time another baby
       came, whom she named Abel.</p>

    <p>When the two boys grew up, they worked, as their father
    worked before them. Cain, the older brother, chose to work in
    the fields, and to raise grain and fruits. Abel, the younger
    brother, had a flock of sheep and became a shepherd.</p>

    <p>While Adam and Eve were living in the Garden of Eden, they
    could talk with God and hear God's voice speaking to them. But
    now that they were out in the world, they could no longer talk
    with God freely, as before. So when they came to God, they
    built an altar of stones heaped up, and upon it, they laid
    something as a gift to God, and burned it, to show that it was
    not their own, but was given to God, whom they could not see.
    Then before the altar they made their prayer to God, and asked
    God to forgive their sins, all that they had done was wrong;
    and prayed God to bless them and do good to them.</p>

    <p>Each of these brothers, Cain and Abel, offered upon the
    altar to God his own gift. Cain brought the fruits and the
    grain which he had grown; and Abel brought a sheep from his
    flock, and killed it and burned it upon the altar. For some
    reason God was pleased with Abel and his offering, but was not
    pleased with Cain and his offering. Perhaps God wished Cain to
    offer something <a name="Page_12"
       id="Page_12"></a>that had life, as Abel offered; perhaps
       Cain's heart was not right when he came before God.</p>

    <p>And God showed that He was not pleased with Cain; and Cain,
    instead of being sorry for his sin, and asking God to forgive
    him, was very angry with God, and angry also toward his brother
    Abel. When they were out in the field together Cain struck his
    brother Abel and killed him. So the first baby in the world
    grew up to be the murderer of his own brother.</p>

    <p>And the Lord said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your
    brother?"</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="CAIN_AND_ABEL"
             id="CAIN_AND_ABEL"><img src="./images/figure4_th.jpg"

             alt="Cain and Abel" /></a><br />
        <i>Cain and Abel</i>
    </div>

    <p>And Cain answered, "I do not know; why should I take care of
    my brother?"</p>

    <p>Then the Lord said to Cain, "What is this that you have
    done? Your brother's blood is like a voice crying to me from
    the ground. Do you see how the ground has opened, like a mouth,
    to drink your brother's blood? As long as you live, you shall
    be under God's curse for the murder of your brother. You shall
    wander over the earth, and <a name="Page_13"
       id="Page_13"></a>shall never find a home, because you have
       done this wicked deed."</p>

    <p>And Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is greater than I
    can bear. Thou hast driven me out from among men; and thou hast
    hid thy face from me. If any man finds me he will kill me,
    because I shall be alone, and no one will be my friend."</p>

    <p>And God said to Cain, "If any one harms Cain, he shall be
    punished for it." And the Lord God placed a mark on Cain, so
    that whoever met him should know him and should know also that
    God had forbidden any man to harm him. Then Cain and his wife
    went away from Adam's home to live in a place by themselves,
    and there they had children. And Cain's family built a city in
    that land; and Cain named the city after his first child, whom
    he had called Enoch.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_NOAH_AND_THE_ARK"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_NOAH_AND_THE_ARK"></a>THE STORY OF NOAH AND
       THE ARK</h2>

    <p>After Abel was slain, and his brother Cain had gone into
    another land, again God gave a child to Adam and Eve. This
    child they named Seth; and other sons and daughters were given
    to them; for Adam and Eve lived many years. But at last they
    died, as God had said they must die, because they had eaten of
    the tree that God had forbidden them to eat.</p>

    <p>By the time that Adam died, there were many people on the
    earth; for the children of Adam and Eve had many other
    children; and when these grew up they had other children; and
    these had children also. These men and women and children lived
    in tents. They owned sheep and cattle, and they moved about
    with them, wherever they could find pasture. The children
    played around the tent doors, and sat beside the camp-fires in
    the evenings, where they all sang together, and the older
    people told them stories. And after a time this land where
    Adam's sons lived began to be full of people.</p>

    <p>It is sad to tell that as time went on more and more of
    these people became wicked, and fewer and fewer of them grew up
    to become good men and women. All the people lived near
    together, and few went away to other lands; so it came to
    <a name="Page_15"
       id="Page_15"></a>pass that even the children of good men and
       women learned to be bad, like the people around them, and no
       longer did what was right and good.</p>

    <p>And as God looked down on the world that he had made, he saw
    how wicked the men in it had become, and that every thought and
    every act of man was evil and only evil continually.</p>

    <p>But while most of the people in the world were very wicked,
    there were some good people also, though they were very few.
    The best of all the men who lived at that time was a man whose
    name was Enoch. He was not the son of Cain, but another Enoch,
    who came from the family of Seth, the son of Adam, who was born
    after the death of Abel. While so many around Enoch were doing
    evil, this man did only what was right. He walked with God and
    God walked with him, and talked with him. And at last, when
    Enoch was a very old man and weary with life, God took him away
    from earth to heaven. He did not die, as all the people have
    since Adam disobeyed God, but "he was not, for God took him."
    This means that Enoch was taken up from earth without
    dying.</p>

    <p>All the people in the time of Enoch were not shepherds. Some
    of them had learned how to make rude bows and arrows and axes
    and plows. And after a long time they melted iron, and they
    <a name="Page_16"
       id="Page_16"></a>made knives and swords and dishes to use in
       their homes. They sowed grain in the fields and reaped
       harvests, and they planted vines and fruit trees. But God
       looked down on the earth and said:</p>

    <p>"I will take away all men from the earth that I have made;
    because the men of the world are evil, and do evil
    continually."</p>

    <p>But even in those bad times God saw one good man. His name
    was Noah. Noah tried to do right in the sight of God. As Enoch
    had walked with God, so Noah walked with God, and talked with
    him. And Noah had three sons; their names were Shem, and Ham,
    and Japheth.</p>

    <p>God said to Noah, "The time has come when all the men and
    women on the earth are to be destroyed. Every one must die,
    because they are all wicked. But you and your family shall be
    saved, because you alone are trying to do right."</p>

    <p>Then God told Noah how he might save his life and the lives
    of his sons. He was to build a very large boat, as large as the
    largest ships that are made in our time; very long, and very
    wide and very deep; with a roof over it; and made like a long,
    wide house in three stories; but so built that it would float
    on the water. Such a ship as this was called "an ark." God told
    Noah to build this ark, and to have it ready for the time when
    he would need it.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_17"
       id="Page_17"></a>For," said God to Noah, "I am going to
       bring a great flood of water on the earth to cover all the
       land and to drown all the people on the earth. And as the
       animals on the earth will be drowned with the people, you
       must make the ark large enough to hold a pair of each kind
       of animals and several pairs of some animals that are needed
       by men, like sheep and goats and oxen; so that there will be
       animals as well as men to live upon the earth after the
       flood has passed away. And you must take in the ark food for
       yourself and your family, and for all the animals with you;
       enough food to last for a year, while the flood shall stay
       on the earth."</p>

    <p>And Noah did what God told him to do, although it must have
    seemed very strange to all the people around, to build this
    great ark where there was no water for it to sail upon. And it
    was a long time, because this ship was so big, that Noah and
    his sons were at work building the ark, which God had told them
    to build, while the wicked people around wondered, and no doubt
    laughed at Noah for building a great ship where there was no
    sea.</p>

    <p>At last the ark was finished, and stood like a great house
    on the land. There was a door on one side, and a window on the
    roof, to let in the light. Then God said to Noah:</p>

    <p>"Come into the ark, you and your wife, and <a name="Page_18"
       id="Page_18"></a>your three sons, and their wives with them;
       for the flood of waters will come very soon. And take with
       you animals of all kinds, and birds, and things that creep;
       seven pairs of these that will be needed by men, and one
       pair of all the rest, so that all kinds of animals may be
       kept alive upon the earth."</p>

    <p>So Noah and his wife, and his three sons, Shem, Ham and
    Japheth, with their wives, went into the ark. And God brought
    to the door of the ark the animals, and the birds, and the
    creeping things of all kinds; and they went into the ark. And
    Noah and his sons put them in their places, and brought in food
    enough to feed them all for many days. And then the door of the
    ark was shut and no more people and no more animals could come
    in.</p>

    <p>In a few days the rain began to fall, as it had never rained
    before. It seemed as though the heavens were opened to pour
    great floods upon the earth. The streams filled, and the rivers
    rose higher and higher, and the ark began to float on the
    water. The people left their houses and ran up to the hills;
    but soon the hills were covered, and all the people on them
    were drowned.</p>

    <p>Some had climbed up to the tops of higher mountains, but the
    water rose higher and higher, until even the mountains were
    covered and all the people, wicked as they had been, were
    <a name="Page_19"
       id="Page_19"></a>drowned in the great sea that now rolled
       over all the earth where man had lived. And all the animals,
       the tame animals, cattle, and sheep, and oxen, were drowned;
       and the wild animals, lions, and tigers, and all the rest
       were drowned also. Even the birds were drowned, for their
       nests in the trees were swept away, and there was no place
       where they could fly from the terrible storm. For forty days
       and nights the rain kept on, until there was no breath of
       life remaining outside of the ark.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="THE_WATER_ROSE_HIGHER_AND_HIGHER"
             id="THE_WATER_ROSE_HIGHER_AND_HIGHER"><img src="./images/figure5_th.jpg"
             title="The water rose higher and higher"
             alt="The water rose higher and higher" /></a><br />
        <i>The water rose higher and higher</i>
    </div>

    <p>After forty days the rain stopped, but the water stayed upon
    the earth for more than six months, and the ark with all that
    were in it floated over the great sea that covered the land.
    Then God sent a wind to blow over the waters, and to dry them
    up; so by degrees the waters grew less and less. First
    mountains rose above the waters, <a name="Page_20"
       id="Page_20"></a>then the hills rose up, and finally the ark
       ceased to float and lay aground on a mountain which is
       called Mount Ararat.</p>

    <p>But Noah could not see what had happened on the earth,
    because the door was shut, and the only window was up in the
    roof. But he felt that the ark was no longer moving, and he
    knew that the water must have gone down. So, after waiting for
    a time, Noah opened a window, and let loose a bird called a
    raven. Now the raven has strong wings; and this raven flew
    round and round until the waters had gone down, and it could
    find a place to rest, and it did not come back to the ark.</p>

    <p>After Noah had waited for it awhile, he sent out a dove; but
    the dove could not find any place to rest, so it flew back to
    the ark, and Noah took it into the ark again. Then Noah waited
    a week longer, and afterward he sent out the dove again. And at
    the evening, the dove came back to the ark, which was its home;
    and in its bill was a fresh leaf which it had picked off from
    an olive tree.</p>

    <p>So Noah knew that the water had gone down enough to let the
    trees grow again. He waited another week, and sent out the dove
    again; but this time the dove flew away and never came back.
    And Noah knew that the earth was becoming dry again. So he took
    off a part of the roof, and looked out, and saw that there was
    dry land all <a name="Page_21"
       id="Page_21"></a>around the ark, and the waters were no
       longer everywhere.</p>

    <p>Noah had now lived in the ark a little more than a year, and
    he was glad to see the green land and the trees once more. And
    God said to Noah:</p>

    <p>"Come out of the ark, with your wife, and your sons, and
    their wives, and all the living things that are with you in the
    ark."</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="SO_NOAH_OPENED_THE_DOOR_OF_THE_ARK"
             id="SO_NOAH_OPENED_THE_DOOR_OF_THE_ARK"><img src="./images/figure6_th.jpg"
             title="So Noah opened the door of the Ark"
             alt="So Noah opened the door of the Ark" /></a><br />
        <i>So Noah opened the door of the Ark</i>
    </div>

    <p>So Noah opened the door of the ark, and with his family came
    out, and stood once more on the ground. And the animals, and
    birds, and creeping things in the ark, came out also, and began
    again to bring life to the earth.</p>

    <p>The first thing that Noah did when he came out of the ark,
    was to give thanks to God for saving all his family when the
    rest of the people on <a name="Page_22"
       id="Page_22"></a>the earth were destroyed. He built an
       altar, and laid upon it an offering to the Lord, and gave
       himself and his family to God and promised to do God's
       will.</p>

    <p>And God was pleased with Noah's offering, and God said:</p>

    <p>"I will not again destroy the earth on account of men, no
    matter how bad they may be. From this time no flood shall again
    cover the earth; but the seasons of spring and summer and fall
    and winter, shall remain without change. I give to you the
    earth; you shall be the rulers of the ground and of every
    living thing upon it."</p>

    <p>Then God caused a rainbow to appear in the sky, and he told
    Noah and his sons that whenever they or the people after them
    should see the rainbow, they should remember that God had
    placed it in the sky and over the clouds as a sign of his
    promise, that he would always remember the earth, and the
    people upon it, and would never again send a flood to destroy
    man from the earth.</p>

    <p>So as often as we see the beautiful rainbow, we are to
    remember that it is the sign of God's promise to the world.</p>

       id="THE_STORY_OF_HAGAR_AND_ISHMAEL"></a>THE STORY OF HAGAR
       AND ISHMAEL</h2>

    <p>After the great flood the family of Noah and those who came
    after him grew in number, until, as the years went on, the
    earth began to be full of people once more. But there was one
    great difference between the people who had lived before the
    flood and those who lived after it. Before the flood, all the
    people stayed close together, so that very many lived in one
    land, and no one lived in other lands. After the flood families
    began to move from one place to another, seeking for themselves
    new homes. Some went one way, and some another, so that as the
    number of people grew, they covered much more of the earth than
    those who had lived before the flood.</p>

    <p>Part of the people went up to the north and built a city
    called Nineveh, which became the ruling city of a great land
    called Assyria, whose people were called Assyrians.</p>

    <p>Another company went away to the west and settled by the
    great river Nile, and founded the land of Egypt, with its
    strange temples and pyramids, its sphinx and its monuments.</p>

    <p>Another company wandered northwest until they came to the
    shore of the great sea which <a name="Page_24"
       id="Page_24"></a>they called the Mediterranean Sea. There
       they founded the cities of Sidon and Tyre, where the people
       were sailors, sailing to countries far away, and bringing
       home many things from other lands to sell to the people of
       Babylon, and Assyria, and Egypt, and other countries.</p>

    <p>Among the many cities which the people built were two called
    Sodom and Gomorrah. The people in these cities were very wicked
    and were nearly all destroyed. One good man named Lot and his
    family escaped. There was another good man named Abraham who
    did not live in these cities. He tried to do God's will and was
    promised a son to bring joy into his family.</p>

    <p>After Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed, Abraham moved his
    tent and his camp away from that part of the land, and went to
    live near a place called Gerar, in the southwest, not far from
    the Great Sea. And there at last, the child whom God had
    promised to Abraham and Sarah, his wife, was born, when
    Abraham, his father, was a very old man.</p>

    <p>They named this child Isaac, as the angel had told them he
    should be named. And Abraham and Sarah were so happy to have a
    little boy, that after a time they gave a great feast and
    invited all the people to come and rejoice with them, and all
    in honor of the little Isaac.</p>

    <p>Now Sarah had a maid named Hagar, an<a name="Page_25"
       id="Page_25"></a> Egyptian woman, who ran away from her
       mistress, and saw an angel by a well, and afterward came
       back to Sarah. She, too, had a child and his name was
       Ishmael. So now there were two boys in Abraham's tent, the
       older boy, Ishmael, the son of Hagar, and the younger boy,
       Isaac, the son of Abraham and Sarah.</p>

    <p>Ishmael did not like the little Isaac, and did not treat him
    kindly. This made his mother Sarah very angry, and she said to
    her husband:</p>

    <p>"I do not wish to have this boy Ishmael growing up with my
    son Isaac. Send away Hagar and her boy, for they are a trouble
    to me."</p>

    <p>And Abraham felt very sorry to have trouble come between
    Sarah and Hagar, and between Isaac and Ishmael; for Abraham was
    a kind and good man, and he was friendly to them all.</p>

    <p>But the Lord said to Abraham, "Do not be troubled about
    Ishmael and his mother. Do as Sarah has asked you to do, and
    send them away. It is best that Isaac should be left alone in
    your tent, for he is to receive everything that is yours. I the
    Lord will take care of Ishmael, and will make a great people of
    his descendants, those who shall come from him."</p>

    <p>So the next morning Abraham sent Hagar and her boy away,
    expecting them to go back to the land of Egypt, from which
    Hagar had come. He gave them some food for the journey, and
    <a name="Page_26"
       id="Page_26"></a>a bottle of water to drink by the way. The
       bottles in that country are not like ours, made of glass.
       They are made from the skin of a goat. One of these
       skin-bottles Abraham filled with water and gave to
       Hagar.</p>

    <p>And Hagar went away from Abraham's tent, leading her little
    boy. But in some way she lost the road, and wandered over the
    desert, not knowing where she was, until all the water in the
    bottle was used up; and her poor boy in the hot sun and the
    burning sand had nothing to drink. She thought that he would
    die of his terrible thirst; and she laid him down under a
    little bush; and then she went away, for she said to

    <p>After this Hagar did not go down to Egypt. She found a place

    from other people. And Ishmael grew up in the desert and
    learned to shoot with the bow and arrow. He became
    <a name="Page_28"
       id="Page_28"></a>a wild man, and his children after him grew

       desert, who even to this day have never been ruled by any
       other people, but wander through the desert, and live as
       they please. So Ishmael came to be the father of many
       people, and his descendants, the wild Arabians of the
       desert, are living unto this day in that land.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_ABRAHAM_AND_ISAAC"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_ABRAHAM_AND_ISAAC"></a>THE STORY OF ABRAHAM
       AND ISAAC</h2>

    <p>You remember that in those times of which we are telling,
    when men worshipped God, they built an altar of earth or of
    stone, and laid an offering upon it as a gift to God. The
    offering was generally a sheep, or a goat, or a young
    ox&mdash;some animal that was used for food. Such an offering
    was called "a sacrifice."</p>

    <p>But the people who worshipped idols often did what seems to
    us strange and very terrible. They thought that it would please
    their gods if they would offer as a sacrifice the most precious
    living things that were their own; and they would take their
    own little children and kill them upon their altars as
    offerings to the gods of wood and stone, that were no real
    gods, but only images.</p>

    <p>God wished to show Abraham and all his descendants, those
    who should come after him, that he was not pleased with such
    offerings as those of living people, killed on the altars. And
    God took a way to teach Abraham, so that he and his children
    after him would never forget it. Then at the same time he
    wished to see how faithful and obedient Abraham would be to his
    <a name="Page_30"
       id="Page_30"></a>commands; how fully Abraham would trust in
       God, or, as we would say, how great was Abraham's faith in
       God.</p>

    <p>So God gave to Abraham a command which he did not mean to
    have obeyed, though this he did not tell to Abraham. He
    said:</p>

    <p>"Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love so
    greatly, and go to the land of Moriah, and there on a mountain
    that I will show you, offer him for a burnt-offering to
    me."</p>

    <p>Though this command filled Abraham's heart with pain, yet he
    would not be as surprised to receive it as a father would in
    our day; for such offerings were very common among all those
    people in the land where Abraham lived. Abraham never for one
    moment doubted or disobeyed God's word. He knew that Isaac was
    the child whom God had promised, and that God had promised,
    too, that Isaac should have children, and that those coming
    from Isaac should be a great nation. He did not see how God
    could keep his promise with regard to Isaac, if Isaac should be
    killed as an offering; unless indeed God should raise him up
    from the dead afterward.</p>

    <p>But Abraham undertook at once to obey. God's command. He
    took two young men with him and an ass laden with wood for the
    fire; and he went toward the mountain in the
    north,<a name="Page_31"
       id="Page_31"></a> Isaac, his son, walking by his side. For
       two days they walked, sleeping under the trees at night in
       the open country. And on the third day Abraham saw the
       mountain far away. And as they drew near to the mountain
       Abraham said to the young men:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="FOR_TWO_DAYS_THEY_WALKED"
             id="FOR_TWO_DAYS_THEY_WALKED"><img src="./images/figure9_th.jpg"
             title="For two days they walked"
             alt="For two days they walked" /></a><br />
        <i>For two days they walked</i>
    </div>

    <p>"Stay here with the ass, while I go up yonder mountain with
    Isaac to worship; and when we have worshipped, we will come
    back to you."<a name="Page_32"
       id="Page_32"></a> For Abraham believed that in some way God
       would bring back Isaac to life. He took the wood from the
       ass and placed it on Isaac, and they two walked up the
       mountain together. As they were walking, Isaac said:</p>

    <p>"Father, here is the wood, but where is the lamb for the
    offering?"</p>

    <p>And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a Lamb
    for a burnt offering."</p>

    <p>And they came to the place on the top of the mountain. There
    Abraham built an altar of stones and earth heaped up; and on it
    he placed the wood. Then he tied the hands and the feet of
    Isaac, and laid him on the altar, on the wood. And Abraham
    lifted up his hand, holding a knife to kill his son. Another
    moment longer and Isaac would be slain by his own father's
    hand.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="GOD_WILL_PROVIDE_HIMSELF_A_LAMB_FOR_A_BURNT_OFFERING"
             id="GOD_WILL_PROVIDE_HIMSELF_A_LAMB_FOR_A_BURNT_OFFERING"><img src="./images/figure10_th.jpg"
             title="God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering"
             alt="God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering" />
        </a><br />
        <i>"God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
        offering"</i>
    </div>

    <p>But just at that moment the angel of the<a name="Page_33"
       id="Page_33"></a> Lord out of heaven called to Abraham, and
       said:</p>

    <p>"Abraham! Abraham!"</p>

    <p>And Abraham answered, "Here I am, Lord." Then the angel of
    the Lord said:</p>

    <p>"Do not lay your hand upon your son. Do no harm to him. Now
    I know that you love God more than you love your only son, and
    that you are obedient to God, since you are ready to give up
    your son, your only son, to God."</p>

    <p>What a relief and a joy these words from heaven brought to
    the heart of Abraham! How glad he was to know that it was not
    God's will for him to kill his son! Then Abraham looked around,
    and there in the thicket was a ram caught by his horns. And
    Abraham took the ram and offered him up for a burnt-offering in
    place of his son. So Abraham's words came true when he said
    that God would provide for himself a lamb.</p>

    <p>The place where this altar was built Abraham named
    Jehovah-jireh, words in the language that Abraham spoke
    meaning, "The Lord will provide."</p>

    <p>This offering, which seems so strange, did much good. It
    showed to Abraham, and to Isaac also, that Isaac belonged to
    God, for to God he had been offered; and in Isaac all those who
    should come from him, his descendants, had <a name="Page_34"
       id="Page_34"></a>been given to God. Then it showed to
       Abraham and to all the people after him, that God did not
       wish children or men killed as offerings for worship; and
       while all the people around offered such sacrifices, the
       Israelites, who came from Abraham and from Isaac, never
       offered them, but offered oxen and sheep and goats
       instead.</p>

    <p>These gifts, which cost so much toil, they felt must be
    pleasing to God, because they expressed their thankfulness to
    him. But they were glad to be taught that God does not desire
    men's lives to be taken, but loves our living gifts of love and
    kindness.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_JACOB"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_JACOB"></a>THE STORY OF JACOB</h2>

    <p>After Abraham died, his son Isaac lived in the land of
    Canaan. Like his father, Isaac had his home in a tent; around
    him were the tents of his people, and many flocks of sheep and
    herds of cattle feeding wherever they could find grass to eat
    and water to drink.</p>

    <p>Isaac and his wife Rebekah had two children. The older was
    named Esau and the younger Jacob.</p>

    <p>Esau was a man of the woods and very fond of hunting; and he
    was rough and covered with hair.</p>

    <p>Jacob was quiet and thoughtful, staying at home, dwelling in
    a tent, and caring for the flocks of his father.</p>

    <p>Isaac loved Esau more than Jacob, because Esau brought to
    his father that which he had killed in his hunting; but Rebekah
    liked Jacob, because she saw that he was wise and careful in
    his work.</p>

    <p>Among the people in those lands, when a man dies, his older
    son receives twice as much as the younger of what the father
    has owned. This was called his "birthright," for it was his
    right as the oldest born. So Esau, as the older, had a
    "birthright" to more of Isaac's possessions
    than<a name="Page_36"
       id="Page_36"></a> Jacob. And besides this, there was the
       privilege of the promise of God that the family of Isaac
       should receive great blessings.</p>

    <p><br />

    <h2><a name="THE_SALE_OF_A_BIRTHRIGHT"
       id="THE_SALE_OF_A_BIRTHRIGHT"></a>THE SALE OF A
       BIRTHRIGHT</h2>

    <p>Now Esau, when he grew up, did not care for his birthright
    or the blessing which God had promised. But Jacob, who was a
    wise man, wished greatly to have the birthright which would
    come to Esau when his father died. Once, when Esau came home,
    hungry and tired from hunting in the fields, he saw that Jacob
    had a bowl of something that he had just cooked for dinner. And
    Esau said:</p>

    <p>"Give me some of that red stuff in the dish. Will you not
    give me some? I am hungry."</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="SELL_ME_YOUR_BIRTHRIGHT"
             id="SELL_ME_YOUR_BIRTHRIGHT"><img src="./images/figure11_th.jpg"
             title="Sell me your birthright"
             alt="Sell me your birthright" /></a><br />
        <i>"Sell me your birthright"</i>
    </div>

    <p><a name="Page_37"
       id="Page_37"></a>And Jacob answered, "I will give it to you,
       if you will first of all sell to me your birthright."</p>

    <p>And Esau said, "What is the use of the birthright to me now,
    when I am almost starving to death? You can have my birthright
    if you will give me something to eat."</p>

    <p>Then Esau made Jacob a solemn promise to give to Jacob his
    birthright, all for a bowl of food. It was not right for Jacob
    to deal so selfishly with his brother; but it was very wrong in
    Esau to care so little for his birthright and God's
    blessing.</p>

    <p>Some time after this, when Esau was forty years old, he
    married two wives. Though this would be very wicked in our
    times, it was not supposed to be wrong then; for even good men
    then had more than one wife. But Esau's two wives were women
    from the people of Canaan, who worshipped idols, and not the
    true God. And they taught their children also to pray to idols;
    so that those who came from Esau, the people who were his
    descendants, lost all knowledge of God, and became very wicked.
    But this was long after that time.</p>

    <p>Isaac and Rebekah were very sorry to have their son Esau
    marry women who prayed to idols and not to God; but still Isaac
    loved his active son Esau more than his quiet son Jacob. But
    Rebekah loved Jacob more than Esau.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_38"
       id="Page_38"></a>Isaac became at last very old and feeble,
       and so blind that he could see scarcely anything. One day he
       said to Esau:</p>

    <p>"My son, I am very old, and do not know how soon I must die.
    But before I die, I wish to give to you, as my older son, God's
    blessing upon you, and your children, and your descendants. Go
    out into the fields, and with your bow and arrows shoot some
    animal that is good for food, and make for me a dish of cooked
    meat such as you know I love; and after I have eaten it I will
    give you the blessing."</p>

    <p>Now Esau ought to have told his father that the blessing did
    not belong to him, for he had sold it to his brother Jacob. But
    he did not tell his father. He went out into the fields
    hunting, to find the kind of meat which his father liked the
    most.</p>

    <p>Now Rebekah was listening, and heard all that Isaac had said
    to Esau. She knew that it would be better for Jacob to have the
    blessing than for Esau; and she loved Jacob more than Esau. So
    she called to Jacob and told him what Isaac had said to Esau,
    and she said:</p>

    <p>"Now, my son, do what I tell you, and you will get the
    blessing instead of your brother. Go to the flocks and bring to
    me two little kids from the goats, and I will cook them just
    like the meat which Esau cooks for your father. And you will
    <a name="Page_39"
       id="Page_39"></a>bring it to your father, and he will think
       that you are Esau, and will give you the blessing; and it
       really belongs to you."</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="NOW_MY_SON_DO_WHAT_I_TELL_YOU"
             id="NOW_MY_SON_DO_WHAT_I_TELL_YOU"><img src="./images/figure12_th.jpg"

             alt="Now, my son, do what I tell you" /></a><br />
        <i>"Now, my son, do what I tell you"</i>
    </div>

    <p>But Jacob said, "You know that Esau and I are not alike. His
    neck and arms are covered with hairs, while mine are smooth. My
    father will feel of me, and he will find that I am
    not<a name="Page_40"
       id="Page_40"></a> Esau; and then, instead of giving me a
       blessing, I am afraid that he will curse me."</p>

    <p>But Rebekah answered her son, "Never mind; you do as I have
    told you, and I will take care of you. If any harm comes it
    will come to me; so do not be afraid, but go and bring the
    meat."</p>

    <p>Then Jacob went and brought a pair of little kids from the
    flocks, and from them his mother made a dish of food, so that
    it would be to the taste just as Isaac liked it. Then Rebekah
    found some of Esau's clothes, and dressed Jacob in them; and
    she placed on his neck and hands some of the skins of the kids,
    so that his neck and his hands would feel rough and hairy to
    the touch.</p>

    <p>Then Jacob came into his father's tent, bringing the dinner,
    and speaking as much like Esau as he could, he said:</p>

    <p>"Here I am, my father."</p>

    <p>And Isaac said, "Who are you, my son?"</p>

    <p>And Jacob answered, "I am Esau, your oldest son; I have done
    as you bade me; now sit up and eat the dinner that I have made,
    and then give me your blessing as you promised me."</p>

    <p>And Isaac said, "How is it that you found it so
    quickly?"</p>

    <p>Jacob answered, "Because the Lord your God showed me where
    to go and gave me good success."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_41"
       id="Page_41"></a>Isaac did not feel certain that it was his
       son Esau, and he said, "Come near and let me feel you, so
       that I may know that you are really my son Esau."</p>

    <p>And Jacob went up close to Isaac's bed, and Isaac felt of
    his face, and his neck, and his hands, and he said:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

             alt="May nations bow down to you." /></a><br />
        <i>"May nations bow down to you."</i>
    </div>

    <p>"The voice sounds like Jacob, but the hands are the hands of
    Esau. Are you really my son Esau?"</p>

    <p>And Jacob told a lie to his father, and said, "I am."</p>

    <p>Then the old man ate the food that Jacob had
    <a name="Page_42"
       id="Page_42"></a>brought to him; and he kissed Jacob,
       believing him to be Esau; and he gave him the blessing,
       saying to him:</p>

    <p>"May God give you the dew of heaven, and the richness of the
    earth, and plenty of grain and wine. May nations bow down to
    you and peoples become your servants. May you be the master
    over your brother, and may your family and descendants that
    shall come from you rule over his family and his descendants.
    Blessed be those that bless you, and cursed be those that curse
    you."</p>

    <p>Just as soon as Jacob had received the blessing he rose up
    and hastened away. He had scarcely gone out, when Esau came in
    from hunting, with the dish of food that he had cooked. And he
    said:</p>

    <p>"Let my father sit up and eat the food that I have brought,
    and give me the blessing."</p>

    <p>And Isaac said, "Why, who are you?"</p>

    <p>Esau answered, "I am your son; your oldest son, Esau."</p>

    <p>And Isaac trembled, and said, "Who then is the one that came
    in and brought to me food? and I have eaten his food and have
    blessed him; yes, and he shall be blessed."</p>

    <p>When Esau heard this, he knew that he had been cheated; and
    he cried aloud, with a bitter cry, "O, my father, my brother
    has taken away <a name="Page_43"
       id="Page_43"></a>my blessing, just as he took away my
       birthright! But cannot you give me another blessing, too?
       Have you given everything to my brother?"</p>

    <p>And Isaac told him all that he had said to Jacob, making him
    the ruler over his brother.</p>

    <p>But Esau begged for another blessing; and Isaac said:</p>

    <p>"My son, your dwelling shall be of the riches of the earth
    and of the dew of heaven. You shall live by your sword and your
    descendants shall serve his descendants. But in time to come
    they shall break loose and shall shake off the yoke of your
    brother's rule and shall be free."</p>

    <p>All this came to pass many years afterward. The people who
    came from Esau lived in a land called Edom, on the south of the
    land of Israel, where Jacob's descendants lived. And after a
    time the Israelites became rulers over the Edomites; and later
    still, the Edomites made themselves free from the Israelites.
    But all this took place hundreds of years afterward.</p>

    <p>It was better that Jacob's descendants, those who came after
    him, should have the blessing, than that Esau's people should
    have it; for Jacob's people worshipped God, and Esau's people
    walked in the way of the idols and became
    wicked.<a name="Page_44"

    <p>After Esau found that he had lost his birthright and his
    blessing, he was very angry against his brother Jacob; and he
    said to himself, and told others:</p>

    <p>"My father Isaac is very old and cannot live long. As soon
    as he is dead, then I shall kill Jacob for having robbed me of
    my right."</p>

    <p>When Rebekah heard this, she said to Jacob, "Before it is
    too late, do you go away from home and get out of Esau's sight.
    Perhaps when Esau sees you no longer, he will forget his anger,
    and then you can come home again. Go and visit my brother
    Laban, your uncle, in Haran, and stay with him for a little
    while."</p>

    <p>We must remember that Rebekah came from the family of Nahor,
    Abraham's younger brother, who lived in Haran, a long distance
    to the northeast of Canaan, and that Laban was Rebekah's
    brother.</p>

    <p>So Jacob went out of Beersheba, on the border of the desert,
    and walked alone, carrying his staff in his hand. One evening,
    just about sunset, he came to a place among the mountains, more
    than sixty miles distant from his home.<a name="Page_45"

       took a stone and rested his head upon it for a pillow, and
       lay down to sleep.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="ANGELS_WERE_UPON_THE_STAIRS"

        <i>Angels were upon the stairs</i>
    </div>

    <p>And on that night Jacob had a wonderful dream. In his dream
    he saw stairs leading from the earth where he lay up to heaven;
    and angels were going up and coming down upon the stairs. And
    above the stairs, he saw the Lord God standing. And God said to
    Jacob:</p>

    <p>"I am the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac
    your father; and I will be your God, too. The land where you
    are lying all alone, shall belong to you and to your children
    after you; and your children shall spread abroad over the
    lands, east and west, and north and south, like the dust of the
    earth; and in your family all the world shall receive a
    blessing. And I am with you in your journey, and I will keep
    you where you are going, and will bring you back to this land.
    I will never leave you, and I will surely keep my promise to
    you."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_46"
       id="Page_46"></a>And in the morning Jacob awakened from his
       sleep, and he said:</p>

    <p>"Surely, the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it! I
    thought that I was all alone, but God has been with me. This
    place is the house of God; it is the gate of heaven!"</p>

    <p>And Jacob took the stone on which his head had rested, and
    he set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on it as an offering
    to God. And Jacob named that place Bethel, which in the
    language that Jacob spoke means "The House of God."</p>

    <p>And Jacob made a promise to God at that time, and said:</p>

    <p>"If God really will go with me and will keep me in the way
    that I go, and will give me bread to eat and will bring me to
    my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God: and
    this stone shall be the house of God, and of all that God gives
    me I will give back to God one-tenth as an offering."</p>

    <p>Then Jacob went onward in his long journey. He walked across
    the river Jordan in a shallow place, feeling his way with his
    staff; he climbed mountains and journeyed beside the great
    desert on the east, and at last came to the city of Haran.
    Beside the city was the well, where Abraham's servant had met
    Jacob's mother, Rebekah; and there, after Jacob had waited for
    <a name="Page_47"
       id="Page_47"></a>a time, he saw a young woman coming with
       her sheep to give them water.</p>

    <p>Then Jacob took off the flat stone that was over the mouth
    of the well, and drew water and gave it to the sheep. And when
    he found that this young woman was his own cousin Rachel, the
    daughter of Laban, he was so glad that he wept for joy. And at
    that moment he began to love Rachel, and longed to have her for
    his wife.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

             </a><br />
        <i>Jacob went onward in his long journey</i>
    </div>

    <p>Rachel's father, Laban, who was Jacob's uncle, gave a
    welcome to Jacob, and took him into his home.</p>

    <p>And Jacob asked Laban if he would give his daughter, Rachel,
    to him as his wife; and Jacob said, "If you give me Rachel, I
    will work for you seven years."</p>

    <p>And Laban said, "It is better that you should have her, than
    that a stranger should marry her."</p>

    <p>So Jacob lived seven years in Laban's house, caring for his
    sheep and oxen and camels; but his love for Rachel made the
    time seem short.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_48"
       id="Page_48"></a>At last the day came for the marriage; and
       they brought in the bride, who, after the manner of that
       land, was covered with a thick veil, so that her face could
       not be seen. And she was married to Jacob, and when Jacob
       lifted up her veil he found that he had married, not Rachel,
       but her older sister, Leah, who was not beautiful, and whom
       Jacob did not love at all.</p>

    <p>Jacob was very angry that he had been deceived,&mdash;though
    that was just the way in which Jacob himself had deceived his
    father and cheated his brother Esau. But his uncle Laban
    said:</p>

    <p>"In our land we never allow the younger daughter to be
    married before the older daughter. Keep Leah for your wife, and
    work for me seven years longer, and you shall have Rachel
    also."</p>

    <p>For in those times, as we have seen, men often had two
    wives, or even more than two. So Jacob stayed seven years more,
    fourteen years in all, before he received Rachel as his
    wife.</p>

    <p>While Jacob was living at Haran, eleven sons were born to
    him. But only one of these was the child of Rachel, whom Jacob
    loved. This son was Joseph, who was dearer to Jacob than any
    other of his children, partly because he was the youngest, and
    because he was the child of his beloved Rachel.</p>

       STORY OF JOSEPH AND HIS COAT OF MANY COLORS</h2>

    <p>After Jacob came back to the land of Canaan with his eleven
    sons, another son was born to him, the second child of his wife
    Rachel, whom Jacob loved so well. But soon after the baby came,
    his mother Rachel died, and Jacob was filled with sorrow. Even
    to this day you can see the place where Rachel was buried, on
    the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Jacob named the child
    whom Rachel left, Benjamin; and now Jacob had twelve sons. Most
    of them were grown-up men; but Joseph was a boy seventeen years
    old, and his brother Benjamin was almost a
    baby.<a name="Page_50"

        <i>Back to the Land of Canaan</i>

    <p>Of all his children, Jacob loved Joseph the best, because he
    was Rachel's child; because he was so much younger than most of
    his brothers; and because he was good, and faithful, and
    thoughtful. Jacob gave to Joseph a robe or coat of bright
    colors, made somewhat like a long cloak with wide sleeves. This
    was a special mark of Jacob's favor to Joseph, and it made his
    older brothers envious of him.</p>

    <p>Then, too, Joseph did what was right, while his older
    brothers often did very wrong acts, of which Joseph sometimes
    told their father; and this made them very angry at Joseph. But
    they hated him still more because of two strange dreams he had,
    and of which he told them. He said one day: "Listen to this
    dream that I have dreamed. I dreamed that we were out in the
    field binding sheaves, when suddenly my sheaf stood up, and all
    your sheaves came around it and bowed down to my sheaf!"</p>

    <p>And they said scornfully, "Do you suppose that the dream
    means that you will some time rule over us, and that we shall
    bow down to you?"</p>

    <p>Then, a few days after, Joseph said, "I have dreamed again.
    This time, I saw in my dream the sun, and the moon, and eleven
    stars, all come and bow to me!"</p>

    <p>And his father said to him, "I do not like you
    <a name="Page_51"
       id="Page_51"></a>to dream such dreams. Shall I, and your
       mother, and your brothers, come and bow down before you as
       if you were a king?"</p>

    <p>His brothers hated Joseph, and would not speak kindly to
    him; but his father thought much of what Joseph had said.</p>

    <p>At one time, Joseph's ten brothers were taking care of the
    flock in the fields near Shechem, which was nearly fifty miles
    from Hebron, where Jacob's tents were spread. And Jacob wished
    to send a message to his sons, and he called Joseph, and said
    to him:</p>

    <p>"Your brothers are near Shechem with the flock. I wish that
    you would go to them, and take a message, and find if they are
    well, and if the flocks are doing well; and bring me word from
    them."</p>

    <p>That was quite an errand, for a boy to go alone over the
    country, and find his way, for fifty miles, and then walk home
    again. But Joseph was a boy who could take care of himself, and
    could be trusted; so he went forth on his journey, walking
    northward over the mountains, past Bethlehem, and Jerusalem,
    and Bethel&mdash;though we are not sure those cities were then
    built, except Jerusalem, which was already a strong city.</p>

    <p>When Joseph reached Shechem, he could not find his brothers,
    for they had taken their flocks <a name="Page_52"
       id="Page_52"></a>to another place. A man met Joseph
       wandering in the field, and asked him, "Whom are you
       seeking?"</p>

    <p>Joseph said, "I am looking for my brothers; the sons of
    Jacob. Can you tell me where I will find them?"</p>

    <p>And the man said, "They are at Dothan; for I heard them say
    that they were going there."</p>

    <p>Then Joseph walked over the hills to Dothan, which was
    fifteen miles further. And his brothers saw him afar off coming
    toward them. They knew him by his bright garment; and one said
    to another: "Look, that dreamer is coming! Come, let us kill
    him, and throw his body into a pit, and tell his father that
    some wild beast has eaten him; and then we will see what
    becomes of his dreams."</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

        <i>Walking northward over the mountains</i>
    </div>

    <p>One of his brothers, whose name was Reuben, felt more kindly
    toward Joseph than the others. He said:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_53"
       id="Page_53"></a>Let us not kill him, but let us throw him
       into this pit, in the wilderness, and leave him there to
       die."</p>

    <p>But Reuben intended, after they had gone away, to lift
    Joseph out of the pit, and take him home to his father. The
    brothers did as Reuben told them; they threw Joseph into the
    pit, which was empty. He cried, and begged them to save him;
    but they would not. They calmly sat down to eat their dinner on
    the grass, while their brother was calling to them from the
    pit.</p>

    <p>After the dinner, Reuben chanced to go to another part of
    the field; so that he was not at hand when a company of men
    passed by with their camels, going from Gilead, on the east of
    the river Jordan, to Egypt, to sell spices and fragrant gum
    from trees to the Egyptians.</p>

    <p>Then Judah, another of Joseph's brothers, said, "What good
    will it do us to kill our brother? Would it not be better for
    us to sell him to these men, and let them carry him away? After
    all, he is our brother, and we would better not kill him."</p>

    <p>His brothers agreed with him; so they stopped the men who
    were passing, and drew up Joseph from the pit, and for twenty
    pieces of silver they sold Joseph to these men; and they took
    him away with them down to Egypt.</p>

    <p>After a while, Reuben came to the pit, where
    <a name="Page_54"
       id="Page_54"></a>they had left Joseph, and looked into it;
       but Joseph was not there. Then Reuben was in great trouble;
       and he came back to his brothers, saying: "The boy is not
       there! What shall I do!"</p>

    <p>Then his brothers told Reuben what they had done; and they
    all agreed together to deceive their father. They killed one of
    the goats, and dipped Joseph's coat in its blood; and they
    brought it to their father, and they said to him: "We found
    this coat out in the wilderness. Look at it, father, and tell
    us if you think it was the coat of your son."</p>

             </a><br />
        <i>For twenty pieces of silver they sold Joseph</i>
    </div>

    <p>And Jacob knew it at once. He said: "It is my son's coat.
    Some wild beast has eaten him. There is no doubt that Joseph
    has been torn in pieces!"</p>

    <p>And Jacob's heart was broken over the loss of Joseph, all
    the more because he had sent Joseph <a name="Page_55"
       id="Page_55"></a>alone on the journey through the
       wilderness. They tried to comfort him, but he would not be
       comforted. He said: "I will go down to the grave mourning
       for my poor lost son."</p>

    <p>So the old man sorrowed for his son Joseph; and all the time
    his wicked brothers knew that Joseph was not dead; but they
    would not tell their father the dreadful deed they had done to
    their brother, in selling him as a slave.<a name="Page_56"

    <h2><a name="THE_DREAMS_OF_A_KING"
       id="THE_DREAMS_OF_A_KING"></a>THE DREAMS OF A KING</h2>

    <p>The men who bought Joseph from his brothers were called
    Ishmaelites, because they belonged to the family of Ishmael,
    who, you remember, was the son of Hagar, the servant of Sarah.
    These men carried Joseph southward over the plain which lies
    beside the great sea on the west of Canaan; and after many days
    they brought Joseph to Egypt. How strange it must have seemed
    to the boy who had lived in tents to see the great river Nile,
    and the cities thronged with people, and the temples, and the
    mighty pyramids!</p>

    <p>The Ishmaelites sold Joseph as a slave to a man named
    Potiphar, who was an officer in the army of Pharaoh, the king
    of Egypt. Joseph was a beautiful boy, and cheerful and willing
    in his spirit, and able in all that he undertook; so that his
    master Potiphar became very friendly to him, and after a time,
    he placed Joseph in charge of his house, and everything in it.
    For some years Joseph continued in the house of Potiphar, a
    slave in name, but in reality the master of all his affairs,
    and ruler over his fellow-servants.</p>

    <p>But Potiphar's wife, who at first was very <a name="Page_57"
       id="Page_57"></a>friendly to Joseph, afterward became his
       enemy, because Joseph would not do wrong to please her. She
       told her husband falsely, that Joseph had done a wicked
       deed. Her husband believed her, and was very angry at
       Joseph, and put him in the prison with those who had been
       sent to that place for breaking the laws of the land. How
       hard it was for Joseph to be charged with a crime, when he
       had done no wrong, and to be thrust into a dark prison among
       wicked people!</p>

    <p>But Joseph had faith in God, that at some time all would
    come out right; and in the prison he was cheerful, and kind,
    and helpful, as he had always been. The keeper of the prison
    saw that Joseph was not like the other men around him, and he
    was kind to Joseph. In a very little while, Joseph was placed
    in charge of all his fellow-prisoners, and took care of them,
    just as he had taken care of everything in Potiphar's house.
    The keeper of the prison scarcely looked into the prison at
    all; for he had confidence in Joseph, that he would be faithful
    and wise in doing the work given to him. Joseph did right, and
    served God, and God blessed Joseph in everything.</p>

    <p>While Joseph was in the prison, two men were sent there by
    the king of Egypt, because he was displeased with them. One was
    the king's chief <a name="Page_58"
       id="Page_58"></a>butler, who served the king with wine; the
       other was the chief baker, who served him with bread. These
       two men were under Joseph's care; and Joseph waited on them,
       for they were men of rank.</p>

    <p>One morning, when Joseph came into the room where the butler
    and the baker were kept, he found them looking quite sad.
    Joseph said to them:</p>

    <p>"Why do you look so sad today?" Joseph was cheerful and
    happy in his spirit; and he wished others to be happy also,
    even in prison.</p>

    <p>And one of them said, "Each one of us dreamed last night a
    very strange dream, and there is no one to tell us what our
    dreams mean."</p>

    <p>For in those times, before God gave the Bible to men, he
    often spoke to men in dreams; and there were wise men who could
    sometimes tell what the dreams meant.</p>

    <p>"Tell me," said Joseph, "what your dreams are. Perhaps my
    God will help me to understand them."</p>

    <p>Then the chief butler told his dream. He said, "In my dream
    I saw a grape-vine with three branches; and as I looked, the
    branches shot out buds; and the buds became blossoms; and the
    blossoms turned into clusters of ripe grapes. And I picked the
    grapes, and squeezed <a name="Page_59"
       id="Page_59"></a>their juice into king Pharaoh's cup, and it
       became wine; and I gave it to king Pharaoh to drink, just as
       I used to do when I was beside his table."</p>

    <p>Then Joseph said, "This is what your dream means. The three
    branches mean three days. In three days, king Pharaoh shall
    call you out of prison and shall put you back in your place;
    and you shall stand at his table, and shall give him his wine,
    as you have given it before. But when you go out of prison,
    please to remember me, and try to find some way to get me, too,
    out of this prison. For I was stolen out of the land of Canaan,
    and sold as a slave; and I have done nothing wrong to deserve
    being put in this prison. Do speak to the king for me, that I
    may be set free."</p>

    <p>Of course, the chief butler felt very happy to hear that his
    dream had so pleasant a meaning. And the chief baker spoke,
    hoping to have an answer as good:</p>

    <p>"In my dream," said the baker, "there were three baskets of
    white bread on my head, one above another, and on the topmost
    basket were all kinds of roasted meat and food for Pharaoh; and
    the birds came, and ate the food from the baskets on my
    head."</p>

    <p>And Joseph said to the baker:</p>

    <p>"This is the meaning of your dream, and I am
    <a name="Page_60"
       id="Page_60"></a>sorry to tell it to you. The three baskets
       are three days. In three days, by order of the king you
       shall be lifted up, and hanged upon a tree; and the birds
       shall eat your flesh from your bones as you are hanging in
       the air."</p>

    <p>And it came to pass just as Joseph had said. Three days
    after that, king Pharaoh sent his officers to the prison. They
    came and took out both the chief butler and the chief baker.
    The baker they hung up by his neck to die, and left his body
    for the birds to pick in pieces. The chief butler they brought
    back to his old place, where he waited at the king's table, and
    handed him his wine to drink.</p>

    <p>You would have supposed that the butler would remember
    Joseph, who had given him the promise of freedom, and had shown
    such wisdom. But in his gladness, he forgot all about Joseph.
    And two full years passed by, while Joseph was still in prison,
    until he was a man thirty years old.</p>

    <p>But one night, king Pharaoh himself dreamed a dream&mdash;in
    fact, two dreams in one. And in the morning he sent for all the
    wise men of Egypt, and told to them his dreams; but there was
    not a man who could give the meaning of them. And the king was
    troubled, for he felt that the dreams had some meaning which it
    was important for him to know.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_61"
       id="Page_61"></a>Then suddenly the chief butler who was by
       the king's table remembered his own dream in the prison two
       years before, and remembered, too, the young man who had
       told its meaning so exactly. And he said:</p>

    <p>"I do remember my faults this day. Two years ago king
    Pharaoh was angry with his servants, with me and the chief
    baker; and he sent us to the prison. While we were in the
    prison, one night each of us dreamed a dream; and the next day
    a young man in the prison, a Hebrew from the land of Canaan,
    told us what our dreams meant; and in three days they came
    true, just as the young Hebrew had said. I think that if this
    young man is in the prison still, he could tell the king the
    meaning of his dreams."</p>

    <p>You notice that the butler spoke of Joseph as "a Hebrew."
    The people of Israel, to whom Joseph belonged, were called
    Hebrews as well as Israelites. The word Hebrew means, "One who
    crossed over," and it was given to the Israelites because
    Abraham, their father, had come from a land on the other side
    of the great river Euphrates, and had crossed over the river on
    his way to Canaan.</p>

    <p>Then king Pharaoh sent in haste to the prison for Joseph;
    and Joseph was taken out, and he was dressed in new garments,
    and was led in to Pharaoh in the palace. And Pharaoh said:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_62"
       id="Page_62"></a>I have dreamed a dream; and there is no one
       who can tell what it means. And I have been told that you
       have power to understand dreams and what they mean."</p>

    <p>And Joseph answered Pharaoh:</p>

    <p>"The power is not in me; but God will give Pharaoh a good
    answer. What is the dream that the king has dreamed?"</p>

    <p>"In my first dream," said Pharaoh, "I was standing by the
    river: and I saw seven fat and handsome cows come up from the
    river to feed in the grass. And while they were feeding, seven
    other cows followed them up from the river, very thin, and
    poor, and lean&mdash;such miserable creatures as I had never
    seen before. And the seven lean cows ate up the seven fat cows;
    and after they had eaten them up, they were as lean and
    miserable as before. Then I awoke.</p>

    <p>"And I fell asleep again, and dreamed again. In my second
    dream, I saw seven heads of grain growing up on one stalk,
    large, and strong, and good. And then seven heads came up after
    them, that were thin, and poor, and withered. And the seven
    thin heads swallowed up the seven good heads; and afterward
    were as poor and withered as before.</p>

    <p>"And I told these two dreams to all the wise men, and there
    is no one who can explain them. Can you tell me what these
    dreams mean?"</p>

    <p><a name="Page_63"
       id="Page_63"></a>And Joseph said to the king:</p>

    <p>"The two dreams have the same meaning. God has been showing
    to king Pharaoh what he will do in this land. The seven good
    cows mean seven years, and the seven good heads of grain mean
    the same seven years. The seven lean cows and the seven thin
    heads of grain also mean seven years. The good cows and the
    good grain mean seven years of plenty, and the seven thin cows
    and thin heads of grain mean seven poor years. There are coming
    upon the land of Egypt seven years of such plenty as have never
    been seen; when the fields shall bring greater crops than ever
    before; and after those years shall come seven years when the
    fields shall bring no crops at all. And then for seven years
    there shall be such need, that the years of plenty will be
    forgotten, for the people will have nothing to eat.</p>

    <p>"Now, let king Pharaoh find some man who is
    <a name="Page_64"
       id="Page_64"></a>able and wise, and let him set this man to
       rule over the land. And during the seven years of plenty,
       let a part of the crops be put away for the years of need.
       If this shall be done, then when the years of need come,
       there will be plenty of food for all the people, and no one
       will suffer, for all will have enough."</p>

    <p>And king Pharaoh said to Joseph: "Since God has shown you
    all this, there is no other man as wise as you. I will appoint
    you to do this work, and to rule over the land of Egypt. All
    the people shall be under you; only on the throne of Egypt I
    will be above you."</p>

    <p>And Pharaoh took from his own hand the ring which held his
    seal, and put on Joseph's hand, so that he could sign for the
    king, and seal in the king's place. And he dressed Joseph in
    robes of fine linen, and put around his neck a gold chain. And
    he made Joseph ride in a chariot which was next in rank to his
    own. And they cried out before Joseph, "Bow the knee." And thus
    Joseph was ruler over all the land of Egypt.<a name="Page_65"

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_MONEY_IN_THE_SACKS"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_MONEY_IN_THE_SACKS"></a>THE STORY OF
       THE MONEY IN THE SACKS</h2>

    <p>When Joseph was made ruler over the land of Egypt, he did
    just as he had always done. It was not Joseph's way to sit
    down, to rest and enjoy himself, and make others wait on him.
    He found his work at once, and began to do it faithfully and
    thoroughly. He went out over all the land of Egypt, and saw how
    rich and abundant were the fields of grain, giving much more
    than the people could use for their own needs. He told the
    people not to waste it, but to save it for the coming time of
    need.</p>

    <p>And he called upon the people to give him for the king one
    bushel of grain out of every five, to be stored up. The people
    brought their grain, after taking for themselves as much as
    they needed, and Joseph stored it up in great storehouses in
    the cities; so much at last that no one could keep account of
    it.</p>

    <p>The king of Egypt gave a wife to Joseph from the noble young
    women of his kingdom. Her name was Asenath; and to Joseph and
    his wife God gave two sons. The oldest son he
    named<a name="Page_66"
       id="Page_66"></a> Manasseh, a word which means "Making to
       Forget."</p>

    <p>"For," said Joseph, "God has made me to forget all my
    troubles and my toil as a slave."</p>

    <p>The second son he named Ephraim, a word that means
    "Fruitful." "Because," said Joseph, "God has not only made the
    land fruitful; but he has made me fruitful in the land of my
    troubles."</p>

    <p>The seven years of plenty soon passed by, and then came the
    years of need. In all the lands around people were hungry, and
    there was no food for them to eat; but in the land of Egypt
    everybody had enough. Most of the people soon used up the grain
    that they had saved; many had saved none at all, and they all
    cried to the king to help them.</p>

    <p>"Go to Joseph!" said king Pharaoh, "and do whatever he tells
    you to do."</p>

    <p>Then the people came to Joseph, and Joseph opened the
    storehouses, and sold to the people all the grain that they
    wished to buy. And not only the people of Egypt came to buy
    grain, but people of all the lands around as well, for there
    was great need and famine everywhere. And the need was as great
    in the land of Canaan, where Jacob lived, as in other lands.
    Jacob was rich in flocks and cattle, and gold and silver, but
    his fields gave no grain, and there was danger
    <a name="Page_67"
       id="Page_67"></a>that his family and his people would
       starve. And Jacob&mdash;who was now called Israel
       also&mdash;heard that there was food in Egypt and he said to
       his sons: "Why do you look at each other, asking what to do
       to find food? I have been told that there is grain in Egypt.
       Go down to that land, and take money with you, and bring
       grain, so that we may have bread, and may live."</p>

    <p>Then the ten older brothers of Joseph went down to the land
    of Egypt. They rode upon asses, for horses were not much used
    in those times, and they brought money with them. But Jacob
    would not let Benjamin, Joseph's younger brother, go with them,
    for he was all the more dear to his father, now that Joseph was
    no longer with him; and Jacob feared that harm might come to
    him.</p>

    <p>Then Joseph's brothers came to Joseph to buy food. They did
    not know him, grown up to be a man, dressed as a prince, and
    seated on a throne. Joseph was now nearly forty years old, and
    it had been almost twenty-three years since they had sold him.
    But Joseph knew them all, as soon as he saw them. He wished to
    be sharp and stern with them, not because he hated them; but
    because he wished to see what their spirit was, and whether
    they were as selfish, and cruel, and wicked as they had been in
    other days.</p>

    <p>They came before him, and bowed, with their
    <a name="Page_68"
       id="Page_68"></a>faces to the ground. Then, no doubt, Joseph
       thought of the dream that had come to him while he was a
       boy, of his brothers' sheaves bending down around his sheaf.
       He spoke to them as a stranger, as if he did not understand
       their language, and he had their words explained to him in
       the language of Egypt.</p>

    <p>"Who are you? And from what place do you come?" said Joseph,
    in a harsh, stern manner.</p>

    <p>They answered him very meekly: "We have come from the land
    of Canaan to buy food."</p>

    <p>"No," said Joseph, "I know what you have come for. You have
    come as spies, to see how helpless the land is, so that you can
    bring an army against us, and make war on us."</p>

    <p>"No, no," said Joseph's ten brothers. "We are no spies. We
    are the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan; and
    we have come for food, because we have none at home."</p>

    <p>"You say that you are the sons of one man, who is your
    father? Is he living? Have you any more brothers? Tell me all
    about yourselves."</p>

    <p>And they said: "Our father is an old man in Canaan. We did
    have a younger brother, but he was lost; and we have one
    brother still, who is the youngest of all, but his father could
    not spare him to come with us."</p>

    <p>"No," said Joseph. "You are not good, honest
    <a name="Page_69"
       id="Page_69"></a>men. You are spies. I shall put you all in
       prison, except one of you; and he shall go and bring that
       youngest brother of yours; and when I see him, then I will
       believe that you tell the truth."</p>

    <p>So Joseph put all the ten men in prison, and kept them under
    guard for three days; then he sent for them again. They did not
    know that he could understand their language, and they said to
    each other, while Joseph heard, but pretended not to hear:
    "This has come upon us because of the wrong that we did to our
    brother Joseph, more than twenty years ago. We heard him cry,
    and plead with us, when we threw him into the pit, and we would
    not have mercy on him. God is giving us only what we have
    deserved."</p>

    <p>And Reuben, who had tried to save Joseph, said: "Did I not
    tell you not to harm the boy? and you would not listen to me.
    God is bringing our brother's blood upon us all."</p>

    <p>When Joseph heard this, his heart was touched, for he saw
    that his brothers were really sorry for the wrong that they had
    done to him. He turned away from them, so that they could not
    see his face, and he wept. Then he turned again to them and
    spoke roughly as before, and said:</p>

    <p>"This I will do, for I serve God. I will let you
    <a name="Page_70"
       id="Page_70"></a>all go home, except one man. One of you I
       will shut up in prison; but the rest of you can go home and
       take food for your people. And you must come back and bring
       your youngest brother with you, and I shall know then that
       you have spoken the truth."</p>

    <p>Then Joseph gave orders, and his servants seized one of his
    brothers, whose name was Simeon, and bound him in their sight
    and took him away to prison. And he ordered his servants to
    fill the men's sacks with grain, and to put every man's money
    back into the sack before it was tied up, so that they would
    find the money as soon as they opened the sack. Then the men
    loaded their asses with the sacks of grain, and started to go
    home, leaving their brother Simeon a prisoner.</p>

    <p>When they stopped on the way to feed their asses, one of the
    brothers opened his sack, and there he found his money lying on
    the top of the grain. He called out to his brothers: "See, here
    is my money given again to me!" And they were frightened, but
    they did not dare to go back to Egypt and meet the stern ruler
    of the land. They went home and told their old father all that
    had happened to them, and how their brother Simeon was in
    prison, and must stay there until they should return, bringing
    Benjamin with them.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_71"
       id="Page_71"></a>When they opened their sacks of grain,
       there in the mouth of each sack was the money that they had
       given; and they were filled with fear. Then they spoke of
       going again to Egypt and taking Benjamin, but Jacob said to
       them:</p>

    <p>"You are taking my sons away from me. Joseph is gone, and
    Simeon is gone, and now you would take Benjamin away. All these
    things are against me!" Reuben said: "Here are my own two boys.
    You may kill them, if you wish, in case I do not bring Benjamin
    back to you." But Jacob said: "My youngest son shall not go
    with you. His brother is dead, and he alone is left to me. If
    harm should come to him, it would bring down my gray hairs with
    sorrow to the grave."</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_MYSTERY_OF_THE_LOST_BROTHER"
       id="THE_MYSTERY_OF_THE_LOST_BROTHER"></a>THE MYSTERY OF THE
       LOST BROTHER</h2>

    <p>The food which Jacob's sons had brought from Egypt did not
    last long, for Jacob's family was large. Most of his sons were
    married and had children of their own; so that the children and
    grandchildren were sixty-six, besides the servants who waited
    on them, and the men who cared for Jacob's flocks. So around
    the tent of Jacob was quite a camp of other tents and an army
    of people.</p>

    <p>When the food that had come from Egypt was nearly eaten up,
    Jacob said to his sons:</p>

    <p>"Go down to Egypt again, and buy some food for us."</p>

    <p>And Judah, Jacob's son, the man who years before had urged
    his brothers to sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites, said to his
    father: "It is of no use for us to go to Egypt, unless we take
    Benjamin with us. The man who rules in that land said to us,
    'You shall not see my face, unless your youngest brother be
    with you'."</p>

    <p>And Israel said, "Why did you tell the man that you had a
    brother? You did me great harm when you told him."</p>

    <p>"Why," said Jacob's sons, "we could not help telling him.
    The man asked us all about our <a name="Page_73"
       id="Page_73"></a>family, 'Is your father yet living? Have
       you any more brothers?' And we had to tell him, his
       questions were so close. How should we know that he would
       say, 'Bring your brother here, for me to see him'?"</p>

    <p>And Judah said, "Send Benjamin with me, and I will take care
    of him. I promise you that I will bring him safely home. If he
    does not come back, let me bear the blame forever. He must go,
    or we shall die for want of food; and we might have gone down
    to Egypt and come home again, if we had not been kept
    back."</p>

    <p>And Jacob said, "If he must go, then he must. But take a
    present to the man, some of the choicest fruits of the land,
    some spices, and perfumes, and nuts, and almonds. And take
    twice as much money, besides the money that was in your sacks.
    Perhaps that was a mistake, when the money was given back to
    you. And take your brother Benjamin, and may the Lord God make
    the man kind to you, so that he will set Simeon free, and let
    you bring Benjamin back. But if it is God's will that I lose my
    children, I cannot help it."</p>

    <p>So ten brothers of Joseph went down a second time to Egypt,
    Benjamin going in place of Simeon. They came to Joseph's
    office, the place where he sold grain to the people; and they
    stood before their brother, and bowed as
    before.<a name="Page_74"
       id="Page_74"></a> Joseph saw that Benjamin was with them,
       and he said to his steward, the man who was over his
       house:</p>

    <p>"Make ready a dinner, for all these men shall dine with me
    today."</p>

    <p>When Joseph's brothers found that they were taken into
    Joseph's house, they were filled with fear. They said to each
    other:</p>

    <p>"We have been taken here on account of the money in our
    sacks. They will say that we have stolen it, and then they will
    sell us all for slaves."</p>

    <p>But Joseph's steward, the man who was over his house,
    treated the men kindly; and when they spoke of the money in
    their sacks, he would not take it again, saying:</p>

    <p>"Never fear; your God must have sent you this as a gift. I
    had your money."</p>

    <p>The stewards received the men into Joseph's house, and
    washed their feet, according to the custom of the land. And at
    noon, Joseph came in to meet them. They brought him the present
    from their father, and again they bowed before him, with their
    faces on the ground.</p>

    <p>And Joseph asked them if they were well, and said: "Is your
    father still living, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he
    well?"</p>

    <p>And they said, "Our father is well and he is living." And
    again they bowed to Joseph.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_75"
       id="Page_75"></a>And Joseph looked at his younger brother
       Benjamin, the child of his own mother Rachel, and said:</p>

    <p>"Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God
    be gracious unto you, my son."</p>

    <p>And Joseph's heart was so full that he could not keep back
    the tears. He went in haste to his own room, and wept there.
    Then he washed his face, and came out again, and ordered the
    table to be set for dinner. They set Joseph's table for
    himself, as the ruler, and another table for his Egyptian
    officers, and another for the eleven men from Canaan; for
    Joseph had brought Simeon out of the prison, and had given him
    a place with his brothers.</p>

    <p>Joseph himself arranged the order of the seats for his
    brothers, the oldest at the head, and all in order of age down
    to the youngest. The men wondered at this, and could not see
    how the ruler of Egypt could know the order of their ages. And
    Joseph sent dishes from his table to his brothers, and he gave
    to Benjamin five times as much as to the others. Perhaps he
    wished to see whether they were as jealous of Benjamin as in
    other days they had been toward him.</p>

    <p>After dinner, Joseph said to his steward: "Fill the men's
    sacks with grain, as much as they can carry, and put each man's
    money in his <a name="Page_76"
       id="Page_76"></a>sack. And put my silver cup in the sack of
       the youngest, with his money."</p>

    <p>The steward did as Joseph had said; and early in the morning
    the brothers started to go home. A little while afterward,
    Joseph said to his steward:</p>

    <p>"Hasten, follow after the men from Canaan, and say, 'Why
    have you wronged me, after I had treated you kindly? You have
    stolen my master's silver cup, out of which he drinks'."</p>

    <p>The steward followed the men, and overtook them, and charged
    them with stealing. And they said to him:</p>

    <p>"Why should you talk to us in this manner? We have stolen
    nothing. Why, we brought back to you the money that we found in
    our sacks; and is it likely that we would steal from your lord
    his silver or gold? You may search us, and if you find your
    master's cup on any of us, let him die, and the rest of us may
    be sold as slaves."</p>

    <p>Then they took down the sacks from the asses, and opened
    them; and in each man's sack was his money, for the second
    time. And when they came to Benjamin's sack, there was the
    ruler's silver cup! Then, in the greatest sorrow, they tied up
    their bags again, and laid them on the asses, and came back to
    Joseph's palace.</p>

    <p>And Joseph said to them:</p>

    <p>"What wicked thing is this that you have <a name="Page_77"
       id="Page_77"></a>done? Did you not know that I would surely
       find out your deeds?"</p>

    <p>Then Judah said, "O, my lord, what can we say? God has
    punished us for our sins; and now we must all be slaves, both
    we that are older, and the younger in whose sack the cup was
    found."</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="WHAT_WICKED_THING_IS_THIS_THAT_YOU_HAVE_DONE"

             </a><br />
        <i>"What wicked thing is this that you have done?"</i>
    </div>

    <p>"No," said Joseph. "Only one of you is guilty; the one who
    has taken away my cup. I will hold him as a slave, and the rest
    of you can go home to your father.</p>

    <p>Joseph wished to see whether his brothers were still
    selfish, and were willing to let Benjamin suffer, if they could
    escape.</p>

    <p>Then Judah, the very man who had urged his <a name="Page_78"
       id="Page_78"></a>brothers to sell Joseph as a slave, came
       forward, and fell at Joseph's feet, and pleaded with him to
       let Benjamin go. He told again the whole story, how Benjamin
       was the one whom his father loved the most of all his
       children, now that his brother was lost. He said:</p>

    <p>"I promised to bear the blame, if this boy was not brought
    home in safety. If he does not go back it will kill my poor old
    father, who has seen much trouble. Now let my youngest brother
    go home to his father, and I will stay here as a slave in his
    place!"</p>

    <p>Joseph knew now, what he had longed to know, that his
    brothers were no longer cruel nor selfish, but one of them was
    willing to suffer, so that his brother might be spared. And
    Joseph could not any longer keep his secret, for his heart
    longed after his brothers; and he was ready to weep again, with
    tears of love and joy. He sent all of his Egyptian servants out
    of the room, so that he might be alone with his brothers, and
    then he said:</p>

    <p>"Come near to me; I wish to speak with you." And they came
    near, wondering. Then Joseph said:</p>

    <p>"I am Joseph; is my father really alive?"</p>

    <p>How frightened his brothers were, as they heard these words
    spoken in their own language by the ruler of Egypt and for the
    first time knew <a name="Page_79"
       id="Page_79"></a>that this stern man, who had their lives in
       his hand, was their own brother whom they had wronged! Then
       Joseph said again:</p>

    <p>"I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. But do
    not feel troubled because of what you did. For God sent me
    before you to save your lives. There have been already two
    years of need and famine, and there are to be five years more,
    when there shall neither be plowing of the fields nor harvest.
    It was not you who sent me here, but God; and he sent me to
    save your lives. God has made me like a father to Pharaoh and
    ruler over all the land of Egypt. Now I wish you to go home,
    and to bring down to me my father and all his family."</p>

    <p>Then Joseph placed his arms around Benjamin's neck, and
    kissed him, and wept upon him. And Benjamin wept on his neck.
    And Joseph kissed all his brothers, to show them that he had
    fully forgiven them; and after that his brothers began to lose
    their fear of Joseph and talked with him more freely.</p>

    <p>Afterward Joseph sent his brothers home with good news, and
    rich gifts, and abundant food. He sent also wagons in which
    Jacob and his sons' wives and the little ones of their families
    might ride from Canaan down to Egypt. And Joseph's brothers
    went home happier than they had been for many years.</p>

       id="THE_STORY_OF_MOSES_THE_CHILD_WHO_WAS_FOUND_IN_THE_RIVER"></a>THE
       STORY OF MOSES, THE CHILD WHO WAS FOUND IN THE RIVER</h2>

    <p>The children of Israel stayed in the land of Egypt much
    longer than they had expected to stay. They were in that land
    about four hundred years. And the going down to Egypt proved a
    great blessing to them. It saved their lives during the years
    of famine and need. After the years of need were over, they
    found the soil in the land of Goshen, that part of Egypt where
    they were living, very rich, so that they could gather three or
    four crops every year.</p>

    <p>Then, too, the sons of Israel, before they came to Egypt,
    had begun to marry the women in the land of Canaan who
    worshipped idols, and not the Lord. If they had stayed there,
    their children would have grown up like the people around them
    and soon would have lost all knowledge of God.</p>

    <p>But in Goshen they lived alone and apart from the people of
    Egypt. They worshipped the Lord God, and were kept away from
    the idols of Egypt. And in that land, as the years went on,
    from being seventy people, they grew in number until they
    became a great multitude. Each of <a name="Page_81"
       id="Page_81"></a>the twelve sons of Jacob was the father of
       a tribe, and Joseph was the father of two tribes, named
       after his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh.</p>

    <p>As long as Joseph lived, and for some time after, the people
    of Israel were treated kindly by the Egyptians, out of their
    love for Joseph, who had saved Egypt from suffering by famine.
    But after a long time another king began to rule over Egypt,
    who cared nothing for Joseph or Joseph's people. He saw that
    the Israelites (as the children of Israel were called) were
    very many, and he feared that they would soon become greater in
    number and in power than the Egyptians.</p>

    <p>He said to his people: "Let us rule these Israelites more
    strictly. They are growing too strong."</p>

    <p>Then they set harsh rules over the Israelites, and laid
    heavy burdens on them. They made the Israelites work hard for
    the Egyptians, and build cities for them, and give to the
    Egyptians a large part of the crops from their fields. They set
    them at work in making brick and in building storehouses. They
    were so afraid that the Israelites would grow in number that
    they gave orders to kill all the little boys that were born to
    the Israelites; though their little girls might be allowed to
    live.</p>

    <p>But in the face of all this hate, and wrong, and
    <a name="Page_82"
       id="Page_82"></a>cruelty, the people of Israel were growing
       in number, and becoming greater and greater.</p>

    <p>At this time, when the wrongs of the Israelites were the
    greatest, and when their little children were being killed, one
    little boy was born.</p>

    <p>He was such a lovely child that his mother kept him hid, so
    that the enemies did not find him. When she could no longer
    hide him, she formed a plan to save his life; believing that
    God would help her and save her beautiful little boy.</p>

    <p>She made a little box like a boat and covered it with
    something that would not let the water into it. Such a boat as
    this covered over was called "an ark." She knew that at certain
    times the daughter of king Pharaoh&mdash;all the kings of Egypt
    were called Pharaoh, for Pharaoh means <a name="Page_83"
       id="Page_83"></a>a king&mdash;would come down to the river
       for a bath. She placed her baby boy in the ark, and let it
       float down the river where the princess, Pharaoh's daughter,
       would see it. And she sent her own daughter, a little girl
       named Miriam, twelve years old, to watch close at hand. How
       anxious the mother and the sister were as they saw the
       little ark floating away from them on the river!</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="SHE_PLACED_HER_BABY_IN_THE_ARK"
             id="SHE_PLACED_HER_BABY_IN_THE_ARK"><img src="./images/figure22_th.jpg"
             title="She placed her baby in the ark"
             alt="She placed her baby in the ark" /></a><br />
        <i>She placed her baby in the ark</i>
    </div>

    <p>Pharaoh's daughter, with her maids, came down to the river,
    and they saw the ark floating on the water, among the reeds.
    She sent one of her maids to bring it to her so that she might
    see what was in the curious box. They opened it, and there was
    a beautiful little baby, who began to cry to be taken up.</p>

    <p>The princess felt kind toward the little one, and loved it
    at once. She said: "This is one of the Hebrews' children." You
    have heard how the children of Israel came to be called
    Hebrews.<a name="Page_84"
       id="Page_84"></a> Pharaoh's daughter thought that it would
       be cruel to let such a lovely baby as this die out on the
       water. And just then a little girl came running up to her,
       as if by accident, and she looked at the baby also, and she
       said: "Shall I go and find some woman of the Hebrews to be a
       nurse to the child for you and take care of it?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," said the princess. "Go and find a nurse for me."</p>

    <p>The little girl&mdash;who was Miriam, the baby's
    sister&mdash;ran as quickly as she could and brought the baby's
    own mother to the princess. Miriam showed in this act that she
    was a wise and thoughtful little girl. The princess said to the
    little baby's mother: "Take this child to your home and nurse
    it for me, and I will pay you wages for it."</p>

    <p>How glad the Hebrew mother was to take her child home! No
    one could harm her boy now, for he was protected by the
    princess of Egypt, the daughter of the king.</p>

    <p>When the child was large enough to leave his mother
    Pharaoh's daughter took him into her own house in the palace.
    She named him "Moses," a word that means "drawn out," because
    he was drawn out of the water.</p>

    <p>So Moses, the Hebrew boy, lived in the palace among the
    nobles of the land, as the son of the princess. There he
    learned much more than he <a name="Page_85"
       id="Page_85"></a>could have learned among his own people;
       for there were very wise teachers. Moses gained all the
       knowledge that the Egyptians had to give. There in the court
       of the cruel king who had made slaves of the Israelites,
       God's people, was growing up our Israelite boy who should at
       some time set his people free!</p>

    <p>Although Moses grew up among the Egyptians, and gained their
    learning, he loved his own people. They were poor and were
    hated, and were slaves, but he loved them, because they were
    the people who served the Lord God, while the Egyptians
    worshipped idols and animals. Strange it was that so wise a
    people as these should bow down and pray to an ox, or to a cat,
    or to a snake, as did the Egyptians.</p>

    <p>When Moses became a man, he went among his own people,
    leaving the riches and ease that he might have enjoyed among
    the Egyptians. He felt a call from God to lift up the
    Israelites and set them free. But at that time he found that he
    could do nothing to help them. They would not let him lead
    them, and as the king of Egypt had now become his enemy, Moses
    went away from Egypt into a country in Arabia, called
    Midian.</p>

    <p>He was sitting by a well, in that land, tired from his long
    journey, when he saw some young women come to draw water for
    their flocks of <a name="Page_86"
       id="Page_86"></a>sheep. But some rough men came, and drove
       the women away, and took the water for their own flocks.
       Moses saw it, and helped the women and drew the water for
       them.</p>

    <p>These young women were sisters, the daughters of a man named
    Jethro, who was a priest in the land of Midian. He asked Moses
    to live with him, and to help him in the care of his flocks.
    Moses stayed with Jethro and married one of his daughters. So
    from being a prince in the king's palace in Egypt, Moses became
    a shepherd in the wilderness of Midian.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_87"
       id="Page_87"></a>But Moses did not remain a shepherd. While
       he was tending his sheep God appeared to him in a burning
       bush and told him that he should return to Egypt and become
       the leader of his people. The Lord told him that the wicked
       Egyptians would be punished for the ill-treatment they were
       giving the Israelites. In your Bible you will find in the
       book of Exodus how God wonderfully fulfilled his promise.
       The Egyptians were punished by many plagues, and finally
       allowed the Israelites to go. They crossed the Red Sea in a
       wonderful way, and traveled for a long time through a
       wilderness, <a name="Page_88"
       id="Page_88"></a>where God fed them day by day with manna
       from heaven. God also gave them rules as a guide for their
       daily living; these rules we call the Ten Commandments; yet
       they forgot the Lord so far as to make images and worship

       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_GRAPES_FROM_CANAAN"></a>THE STORY OF
       THE GRAPES FROM CANAAN</h2>

    <p>The Israelites stayed in their camp before Mount Sinai
    almost a year, while they were building the Tabernacle and
    learning God's laws given through Moses. At last the cloud over
    the Tabernacle rose up, and the people knew that this was the
    sign for them to move. They took down the Tabernacle and their
    own tents, and journeyed toward the land of Canaan for many
    days.</p>

    <p>At last they came to a place just on the border between the
    desert and Canaan, called Kadesh, or Kadesh-barnea. Here they
    stopped to rest, for there were many springs of water and some
    grass for their cattle. While they were waiting at
    Kadesh-barnea and were expecting soon to march into the land
    which was to be their home, God told Moses to send onward some
    men who should walk through the land and look at it, and then
    come back and tell what they had found; what kind of a land it
    was, and what fruits grew in it, and what people were living in
    it. The Israelites could more easily win the land if these men,
    after walking through it, could act as their guides and point
    out the best places in it and the best plans of making war upon
    it.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_90"

        <a name="A_CLUSTER_OF_GRAPES_SO_LARGE_THAT_TWO_MEN_CARRIED_IT"

        <i>A cluster of grapes so large that two men carried
        it.</i>
    </div>

    <p>So Moses chose out some men of high rank among the people,
    one ruler from each tribe, twelve men in all. One of these was
    Joshua, who was the helper of Moses in caring for the people,
    and another was Caleb, who belonged to the <a name="Page_91"
       id="Page_91"></a>tribe of Judah. These twelve men went out
       and walked over the mountains of Canaan and looked at the
       cities and saw the fields. In one place, just before they
       came back to the camp, they cut down a cluster of ripe
       grapes which was so large that two men carried it between
       them, hanging from a staff. They named the place where they
       found this bunch of grapes Eshcol, a word which means "a
       cluster." These twelve men were called "spies," because they
       went "to spy out the land"; and after forty days they came
       back to the camp, and this was what they said:</p>

    <p>"We walked all over the land and found it a rich land. There
    is grass for all our flocks, and fields where we can raise
    grain, and trees bearing fruits, and streams running down the
    sides of the hills. But we found that the people who live there
    are very strong and are men of war. They have cities with walls
    that reach almost up to the sky; and some of the men are
    giants, so tall that we felt that we were like grasshoppers
    beside them."</p>

    <p>One of the spies, who was Caleb, said, "All that is true,
    yet we need not be afraid to go up and take the land. It is a
    good land, well worth fighting for; God is on our side, and he
    will help us to overcome those people."</p>

    <p>But all the other spies, except Joshua,
    said,<a name="Page_92"
       id="Page_92"></a> "No, there is no use in trying to make war
       upon such strong people. We can never take those walled
       cities, and we dare not fight those tall giants."</p>

    <p>And the people, who had journeyed all the way through the
    wilderness to find this very land, were so frightened by the
    words of the ten spies that now, on the very border of Canaan,
    they dared not enter it. They forgot that God had led them out
    of Egypt, that he had kept them in the dangers of the desert,
    that he had given them water out of the rock, and bread from
    the sky, and his law from the mountain.</p>

    <p>All that night, after the spies had brought back their
    report, the people were so frightened that they could not
    sleep. They cried out against Moses, and blamed him for
    bringing them out of the land of Egypt. They forgot all their
    troubles in Egypt, their toil and their slavery, and resolved
    to go back to that land. They said:</p>

    <p>"Let us choose a ruler in place of Moses, who has brought us
    into all these evils, and let us turn back to the land of
    Egypt!"</p>

    <p>But Caleb and Joshua, two of the spies, said, "Why should we
    fear? The land of Canaan is a good land; it is rich with milk
    and honey. If God is our friend and is with us, we can easily
    conquer the people who live there. Above all <a name="Page_93"
       id="Page_93"></a>things, let us not rebel against the Lord,
       or disobey him, and make him our enemy."</p>

    <p>But the people were so angry with Caleb and Joshua that they
    were ready to stone them and kill them. Then suddenly the
    people saw a strange sight. The glory of the Lord, which stayed
    in the Holy of Holies, the inner room of the Tabernacle, now
    flashed out, and shone from the door of the Tabernacle.</p>

    <p>And the Lord, out of this glory, spoke to Moses, and said,
    "How long will this people disobey me and despise me? They
    shall not go into the good land that I have promised them. Not
    one of them shall enter in, except Caleb and Joshua, who have
    been faithful to me. All the people who are twenty years old
    and over it shall die in the desert; but their little children
    shall grow up in the wilderness, and when they become men they
    shall enter in and own the land that I promised to their
    fathers. You people are not worthy of the land that I have been
    keeping for you. Now turn back into the desert and stay there
    until you die. After you are dead, Joshua shall lead your
    children into the land of Canaan. And because Caleb showed
    another spirit and was true to me, and followed my will fully,
    Caleb shall live to go into the land, and shall have his choice
    of a home there. To-morrow, turn back into the desert by the
    way of the Red Sea."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_94"
       id="Page_94"></a>And God told Moses that for every day that
       the spies had spent in Canaan, looking at the land the
       people should spend a year in the wilderness; so that they
       should live in the desert forty years, instead of going at
       once into the promised land.</p>

    <p>When Moses told all God's words to the people they felt
    worse than before. They changed their minds as suddenly as they
    had made up their minds.</p>

    <p>"No," they all said, "we will not go back to the wilderness;
    we will go straight into the land, and see if we are able to
    take it, as Joshua and Caleb have said."</p>

    <p>"You must not go into the land," said Moses.</p>

    <p>But the people would not obey. They marched up the mountain
    and tried to march at once into the land. But they were without
    leaders and without order&mdash;a mob of men, untrained and in
    confusion. And the people in that part of the land, the
    Canaanites and the Amorites, came down upon them and killed
    many of them and drove them away. Then, discouraged and beaten,
    they obeyed the Lord and Moses, and went once more into the
    desert.</p>

    <p>And in the desert of Paran, on the south of the land of
    Canaan, the children of Israel stayed nearly forty years; and
    all because they would not trust in the Lord.</p>

       STORY OF GIDEON AND HIS THREE HUNDRED SOLDIERS</h2>

    <p>At last the people of Israel came into the promised land,
    but they did evil in the sight of the Lord in worshipping Baal;
    and the Lord left them to suffer for their sins. Once the
    Midianites, living near the desert on the east of Israel, came
    against the tribes. The two tribes that suffered the hardest
    fate were Ephraim, and the part of Manasseh on the west of
    Jordan. For seven years the Midianites swept over their land
    every year, just at the time of harvest, and carried away all
    the crops of grain, until the Israelites had no food for
    themselves, and none for their sheep and cattle. The Midianites
    brought also their own flocks and camels without number, which
    ate all the grass of the field.</p>

    <p>The people of Israel were driven away from their villages
    and their farms, and were compelled to hide in the caves of the
    mountains. And if any Israelite could raise any grain, he
    buried it in pits covered with earth, or in empty winepresses,
    where the Midianites could not find it.</p>

    <p>One day, a man named Gideon was threshing <a name="Page_96"
       id="Page_96"></a>out wheat in a hidden place, when he saw an
       angel sitting-under an oak-tree. The angel said to him: "You
       are a brave man, Gideon, and the Lord is with you. Go out
       boldly, and save your people from the power of the
       Midianites." Gideon answered the angel:</p>

        <i>The angel touched the offering with his staff.</i>
    </div>

    <p>"O, Lord, how can I save Israel? Mine is a poor family in
    Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house."</p>

    <p>And the Lord said to him: "Surely I will be With you, and I
    will help you drive out the Midianites."</p>

    <p>Gideon felt that it was the Lord who was talking with him,
    in the form of an angel. He <a name="Page_97"
       id="Page_97"></a>brought an offering, and laid it on a rock
       before the angel. Then the angel touched the offering with
       his staff. At once, a fire leaped up and burned the
       offering; and then the angel vanished from his sight. Gideon
       was afraid when he saw this; but the Lord said to him:
       "Peace be unto you, Gideon, do not fear, for I am with
       you."</p>

    <p>On the spot where the Lord appeared to Gideon, under an oak
    tree, near the village of Ophrah, in the tribe-land of
    Manasseh, Gideon built an altar and called it by a name which
    means: "The Lord is peace." This altar was standing long
    afterward in that place.</p>

    <p>Then the Lord told Gideon that before setting his people
    free from the Midianites, he must first set them free from the
    service of Baal and Asherah, the two idols most worshipped
    among them. Near the house of Gideon's own father stood an
    altar to Baal, and the image of Asherah.</p>

    <p>On that night, Gideon went out with ten men, and threw down
    the image of Baal, and cut in pieces the wooden image of
    Asherah, and destroyed the altar before these idols. And in its
    place he built an altar to the God of Israel; and on it laid
    the broken pieces of the idols for wood, and with them offered
    a young ox as a burnt-offering.</p>

    <p>On the next morning, when the people of the
    <a name="Page_98"
       id="Page_98"></a>village went out to worship their idols,
       they found them cut in pieces, the altar taken away; in its
       place an altar of the Lord, and on it the pieces of the
       Asherah were burning as wood under a sacrifice to the Lord.
       The people looked at the broken and burning idols; and they
       said: "Who has done this?"</p>

    <p>Some one said: "Gideon, the son of Joash, did this last
    night."</p>

    <p>Then they came to Joash, Gideon's father, and said:</p>

    <p>"We are going to kill your son because he has destroyed the
    image of Baal, who is our god."</p>

    <p>And Joash, Gideon's father, said: "If Baal is a god, he can
    take care of himself, and punish the man who has destroyed his
    image. Why should you help Baal? Let Baal help himself."</p>

    <p>And when they saw that Baal could not harm the man who had
    broken down his altar and his image, the people turned from
    Baal, back to their own Lord God.</p>

    <p>Gideon sent messengers through all Manasseh on the west of
    Jordan, and the tribes near on the north; and the men of the
    tribes gathered around him, with a few swords and spears, but
    very few, for the Israelites were not ready for war. They met
    beside a great spring on Mount Gilboa, called "the fountain of
    Harod." Mount Gilboa is one of the three mountains on the east
    of the <a name="Page_99"
       id="Page_99"></a>plain of Esdraelon, or the plain of
       Jezreel, where once there had been a great battle. On the
       plain, stretching up the side of another of these mountains,
       called "the Hill of Moreh," was the camp of a vast Midianite
       army. For as soon as the Midianites heard that Gideon had
       undertaken to set his people free, they came against him
       with a mighty host.</p>

    <p>Gideon was a man of faith. He wished to be sure that God was
    leading him, and he prayed to God and said:</p>

    <p>"O Lord God, give me some sign that thou wilt save Israel
    through me. Here is a fleece of wool on this threshing floor.
    If to-morrow morning the fleece is wet with dew, while the
    grass around it is dry, then I shall know that thou art with
    me; and that thou wilt give me victory over the
    Midianites."</p>

    <p>Very early the next morning, Gideon came to look at the
    fleece. He found it wringing wet with dew, while all around the
    grass was dry. But Gideon was not yet satisfied. He said to the
    Lord:</p>

    <p>"O Lord, be not angry with me; but give me just one more
    sign. To-morrow morning let the fleece be dry, and let the dew
    fall all around it, and then I will doubt no more."</p>

    <p>The next morning, Gideon found the grass, and the bushes wet
    with dew, while the fleece of <a name="Page_100"
       id="Page_100"></a>wool was dry. And Gideon was now sure that
       God had called him, and that God would give him victory over
       the enemies of Israel.</p>

    <p>The Lord said to Gideon: "Your army is too large. If Israel
    should win the victory, they would say, 'we won it by our own
    might.' Send home all those who are afraid to fight."</p>

    <p>For many of the people were frightened, as they looked at
    the host of their enemies, and the Lord knew that these men
    would only hinder the rest in the battle. So Gideon sent word
    through the camp:</p>

    <p>"Whoever is afraid of the enemy may go home." And twenty-two
    thousand people went away, leaving only ten thousand in
    Gideon's army. But the army was stronger though it was smaller,
    for the cowards had gone, and only the brave men were left.</p>

    <p>But the Lord said to Gideon: "The people are yet too many.
    You need only a few of the bravest and best men to fight in
    this battle. Bring the men down the mountain, past the water,
    and I will show you there how to find the men whom you
    need."</p>

    <p>In the morning Gideon, by God's command called his ten
    thousand men out, and made them march down the hill, just as
    though they were going to attack the enemy. And as they were
    beside the water, he noticed how they drank, and
    <a name="Page_101"
       id="Page_101"></a>set them apart in two companies, according
       to their way of drinking.</p>

    <p>When they came to the water, most of the men threw aside
    their shields and spears, and knelt down and scooped up a draft
    of the water with both hands together like a cup. These men
    Gideon commanded to stand in one company.</p>

    <p>There were a few men who did not stop to take a large draft
    of water. Holding spear and shield in the right hand, to be
    ready for the enemy if one should suddenly appear, they merely
    caught up a handful of the water in passing and marched on,
    lapping up the water from one hand. God said to Gideon:</p>

    <p>"Set by themselves these men who lapped up each a handful of
    water. These are the men whom I have chosen to set Israel
    free."</p>

    <p>Gideon counted these men, and found that there were only
    three hundred of them, while all the rest bowed down on their
    faces to drink. The difference between them was that the three
    hundred were earnest men, of one purpose; not turning aside
    from their aim even to drink, as the others did. Then, too,
    they were watchful men, always ready to meet their enemies.</p>

    <p>So Gideon, at God's command, sent back to the camp on Mount
    Gilboa all the rest of his army, nearly ten thousand men,
    keeping with himself only his little band of three hundred.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_102"
       id="Page_102"></a>Gideon's plan did not need a large army;
       but it needed a few careful, bold men, who should do exactly
       as their leader commanded them. He gave to each man a lamp,
       a pitcher, and a trumpet, and told the men just what was to
       be done with them. The lamp was lighted, but was placed
       inside the pitcher, so that it could not be seen. He divided
       his men into three companies, and very quietly led them down
       the mountain in the middle of the night, and arranged them
       all in order around the camp of the Midianites.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="THE_MEN_BLEW_THEIR_TRUMPETS_WITH_A_MIGHTY_NOISE"

             </a><br />
        <i>The men blew their trumpets with a mighty noise.</i>
    </div>

    <p>Then at one moment a great shout rang out in the darkness,
    "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon," and after it came a
    crash of breaking pitchers, and then a flash of light in every
    direction. The three hundred men had given the shout, and
    broken their pitchers, <a name="Page_103"
       id="Page_103"></a>so that on every side lights were shining.
       The men blew their trumpets with a mighty noise; and the
       Midianites were roused from sleep, to see enemies all round
       them, lights beaming and swords flashing, while everywhere
       the sharp sound of the trumpets was heard.</p>

    <p>They were filled with sudden terror, and thought only of
    escape, not of fighting. But wherever they turned, their
    enemies seemed to be standing with swords drawn. They trampled
    each other down to death, flying from the Israelites. Their own
    land was in the east, across the river Jordan, and they fled in
    that direction, down one of the valleys between the
    mountains.</p>

    <p>Gideon had thought that the Midianites would turn toward
    their own land, if they should be beaten in the battle, and he
    had already planned to cut off their flight. The ten thousand
    men in the camp he had placed on the sides of the valley
    leading to the Jordan. There they slew very many of the
    Midianites as they fled down the steep pass toward the river.
    And Gideon had also sent to the men of the tribe of Ephraim,
    who had thus far taken no part in the war, to hold the only
    place at the river where men could wade through the water.
    Those of the Midianites who had escaped from Gideon's men on
    either side of the valley were now met by the Ephraimites at
    the river, and many more of them were slain.<a name="Page_104"
       id="Page_104"></a> Among the slain were two of the princes
       of the Midianites, named Oreb and Zeeb.</p>

    <p>A part of the Midianite army was able to get across the
    river, and to continue its flight toward the desert; but Gideon
    and his brave three hundred men followed closely after them,
    fought another battle with them, destroyed them utterly, and
    took their two kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, whom he killed. After
    this great victory the Israelites were freed forever from the
    Midianites. They never again ventured to leave their home in
    the desert to make war on the tribes of Israel.</p>

    <p>After this, as long as Gideon lived, he ruled as Judge in
    Israel. The people wished him to make himself a king.</p>

    <p>"Rule over us as king," they said, "and let your son be king
    after you, and his son king after him."</p>

    <p>But Gideon said:</p>

    <p>"No, you have a king already; for the Lord God is the King
    of Israel. No one but God shall be king over these tribes."</p>

    <p>Of all the fifteen men who ruled as Judges of Israel,
    Gideon, the fifth Judge, was the greatest, in courage, in
    wisdom, and in faith in God.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_SAMSON_THE_STRONG_MAN"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_SAMSON_THE_STRONG_MAN"></a>THE STORY OF
       SAMSON, THE STRONG MAN</h2>

    <p>Now we are to learn of three judges who ruled Israel in
    turn. Their names were Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon. None of these
    were men of war, and in their days the land was quiet.</p>

    <p>But the people of Israel again began to worship idols; and
    as a punishment God allowed them once more to pass under the
    power of their enemies. The seventh oppression, which now fell
    upon Israel, was by far the hardest, the longest and the most
    widely spread of any, for it was over all the tribes. It came
    from the Philistines, a strong and warlike people who lived on
    the west of Israel upon the plain beside the Great Sea. They
    worshipped an idol called Dagon, which was made in the form of
    a fish's head on a man's body.</p>

    <p>These people, the Philistines, sent their armies up from the
    plain beside the sea to the mountains of Israel and overran all
    the land. They took away from the Israelites all their swords
    and spears, so that they could not fight; and they robbed their
    land of all the crops, so that the people suffered for want of
    food. And as <a name="Page_106"
       id="Page_106"></a>before, the Israelites in their trouble,
       cried out to the Lord, and the Lord heard their prayer.</p>

    <p>In the tribe-land of Dan, which was next to the country of
    the Philistines, there was living a man named Manoah. One day
    an angel came to his wife and said:</p>

    <p>"You shall have a son, and when he grows up he will begin to
    save Israel from the hand of the Philistines. But your son must
    never drink any wine or strong drink as long as he lives. And
    his hair must be allowed to grow long and must never be cut,
    for he shall be a Nazarite under a vow to the Lord."</p>

    <p>When a child was given especially to God, or when a man gave
    himself to some work for God, he was forbidden to drink wine,
    and as a sign, his hair was left to grow long while the vow or
    promise to God was upon him. Such a person as this was called a
    Nazarite, a word which means "one who has a vow"; and Manoah's
    child was to be a Nazarite, and under a vow, as long as he
    lived.</p>

    <p>The child was born and was named Samson. He grew up to
    become the strongest man of whom the Bible tells. Samson was no
    general, like Gideon or Jephthah, to call out his people and
    lead them in war. He did much to set his people free; but all
    that he did was by his own strength.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_107"
       id="Page_107"></a>When Samson became a young man he went
       down to Timnath, in the land of the Philistines. There he
       saw a young Philistine woman whom he loved, and wished to
       have as his wife. His father and mother were not pleased
       that he should marry among the enemies of his own people.
       They did not know that God would make this marriage the
       means of bringing harm upon the Philistines and of helping
       the Israelites.</p>

    <p>As Samson was going down to Timnath to see this young woman,
    a hungry lion came out of the mountain, roaring against him.
    Samson seized the lion, and tore him in pieces as easily as
    another man would have killed a little kid of the goats, and
    then went on his way. He made his visit and came home, but said
    nothing to any one about the lion.</p>

    <p>After a time Samson went again to Timnath for his marriage
    with the Philistine woman. On his way he stopped to look at the
    dead lion; and in its body he found a swarm of bees, and honey
    which they had made. He took some of the honey and ate it as he
    walked, but told no one of it.</p>

    <p>At the wedding-feast, which lasted a whole week, there were
    many Philistine young men, and they amused each other with
    questions and riddles.</p>

    <p>"I will give you a riddle," said Samson. "If
    <a name="Page_108"
       id="Page_108"></a>you answer it during the feast, I will
       give you thirty suits of clothing; and if you cannot answer
       it then you must give me the thirty suits of clothing." "Let
       us hear your riddle," they said. And this was Samson's
       riddle:</p>

    <p>"Out of the eater came forth meat, And out of the strong
    came forth sweetness."</p>

    <p>They could not find the answer, though they tried to find it
    all that day and the two days that followed. And at last they
    came to Samson's wife and said to her:</p>

    <p>"Coax your husband to tell you the answer. If you do not
    find it out, we will set your house on fire, and burn you and
    all your people."</p>

    <p>And Samson's wife urged him to tell her the answer. She
    cried and pleaded with him and said:</p>

    <p>"If you really loved me, you would not keep this a secret
    from me."</p>

    <p>At last Samson yielded, and told his wife how he had killed
    the lion and afterward found the honey in its body. She told
    her people, and just before the end of the feast they came to
    Samson with the answer. They said:</p>

    <p>"What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a
    lion?" And Samson said to them:</p>

    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"If you had not plowed with
    my heifer,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">You had not found out my
    riddle."</span><br />
    <br /></p>

    <p><a name="Page_109"
       id="Page_109"></a>By his "heifer,"&mdash;which is a young
       cow,&mdash;of course Samson meant his wife. Then Samson was
       required to give them thirty suits of clothing. He went out
       among the Philistines, killed the first thirty men whom he
       found, took off their clothes, and gave them to the guests
       at the feast. But all this made Samson very angry. He left
       his wife and went home to his father's house. Then the
       parents of his wife gave her to another man.</p>

    <p>But after a time Samson's anger passed away, and he went
    again to Timnath to see his wife. But her father said to
    him:</p>

    <p>"You went away angry, and I supposed that you cared nothing
    for her. I gave her to another man, and now she is his wife.
    But here is her younger sister; you can have her for your wife,
    instead."</p>

    <p>But Samson would not take his wife's sister. He went out
    very angry; determined to do harm to the Philistines, because
    they had cheated him. He caught all the wild foxes that he
    could find, until he had three hundred of them. Then he tied
    them together in pairs, by their tails; and between each pair
    of foxes he tied to their tails a piece of dry wood which he
    set on fire. These foxes with firebrands on their tails he
    turned loose among the fields of the Philistines when the grain
    was ripe. They ran wildly over the <a name="Page_110"
       id="Page_110"></a>fields, set the grain on fire, and burned
       it; and with the grain the olive trees in the fields.</p>

    <p>When the Philistines saw their harvests destroyed, they
    said, "Who has done this?"</p>

    <p>And the people said, "Samson did this, because his wife was
    given by her father to another man."</p>

    <p>The Philistines looked on Samson's father-in-law as the
    cause of their loss; and they came and set his home on fire,
    and burned the man and his daughter whom Samson had married.
    Then Samson came down again, and alone fought a company of
    Philistines, and killed them all, as a punishment for burning
    his wife.</p>

    <p>After this Samson went to live in a hollow place in a split
    rock, called the rock of Etam. The Philistines came up in a
    great army, and overran the fields in the tribe-land of
    Judah.</p>

    <p>"Why do you come against us?" asked the men of Judah, "what
    do you want from us?"</p>

    <p>"We have come," they said, "to bind Samson, and to deal with
    him as he has dealt with us."</p>

    <p>The men of Judah said to Samson:</p>

    <p>"Do you not know that the Philistines are ruling over us?
    Why do you make them angry by killing their people? You see
    that we suffer through your pranks. Now we must bind you and
    give you to the Philistines, or they will ruin us all."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_111"
       id="Page_111"></a>And Samson said, "I will let you bind me,
       if you will promise not to kill me yourselves; but only to
       give me safely into the hands of the Philistines."</p>

    <p>They made the promise; and Samson gave himself up to them,
    and allowed them to tie him up fast with new ropes. The
    Philistines shouted for joy as they saw their enemy brought to
    them, led in bonds by his own people. But as soon as Samson
    came among them, he burst the bonds as though they had been
    light strings; and picked up from the ground the jawbone of an
    ass, and struck right and left with it as with a sword. He
    killed almost a thousand of the Philistines with this strange
    weapon. Afterward he sang a song about it, thus:</p>

    <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"With the jawbone of an ass,
    heaps upon heaps,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">With the jawbone of an ass,
    have I slain a thousand men."</span><br />
    <br /></p>

    <p>After this Samson went down to the chief city of the
    Philistines, which was named Gaza. It was a large city; and
    like all large cities, was surrounded with a high wall. When
    the men of Gaza found Samson in their city, they shut the
    gates, thinking that they could now hold him as a prisoner. But
    in the night Samson rose up, went to the gates, pulled their
    posts out of <a name="Page_112"
       id="Page_112"></a>the ground, and put the gates with their
       posts upon his shoulder. He carried off the gates of the
       city and left them on the top of a hill not far from the
       city of Hebron.</p>

    <p>After this Samson saw another woman among the Philistines,
    and he loved her. The name of this woman was Delilah. The
    rulers of the Philistines came to Delilah and said to her:</p>

    <p>"Find out, if you can, what it is that makes Samson so
    strong, and tell us. If you help us to get control of him, so
    that we can have him in our power, we will give you a great sum
    of money."</p>

        <i>He carried off the gates of the city</i>
    </div>

    <p>And Delilah coaxed and pleaded with Samson to tell her what
    it was that made him so strong. Samson said to her:</p>

    <p>"If they will tie me with seven green twigs
    <a name="Page_113"
       id="Page_113"></a>from a tree, then I shall not be strong
       any more."</p>

    <p>They brought her seven green twigs, like those of a willow
    tree; and she bound Samson with them while he was asleep. Then
    she called out to him:</p>

    <p>"Wake up, Samson, the Philistines are coming against
    you!"</p>

    <p>And Samson rose up and broke the twigs as easily as if they
    had been charred in the fire, and went away with ease.</p>

    <p>And Delilah tried again to find his secret. She said:</p>

    <p>"You are only making fun of me. Now tell me truly how you
    can be bound." And Samson said:</p>

    <p>"Let them bind me with new ropes that have never been used
    before; and then I cannot get away."</p>

    <p>While Samson was asleep again, Delilah bound him with new
    ropes. Then she called out as before:</p>

    <p>"Get up, Samson, for the Philistines are coming!" And when
    Samson rose up, the ropes broke as if they were thread. And
    Delilah again urged him to tell her; and he said:</p>

    <p>"You notice that my long hair is in seven locks. Weave it
    together in the loom, just as if it were the threads in a piece
    of cloth."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_114"
       id="Page_114"></a>Then, while he was asleep, she wove his
       hair in the loom, and fastened it with a large pin to the
       weaving-frame. But when he awoke, he rose up, and carried
       away the pin and the beam of the weaving-frame; for he was
       as strong as before.</p>

    <p>And Delilah, who was anxious to serve her people, said:</p>

    <p>"Why do you tell me that you love me, as long as you deceive
    me and keep from me your secret?" And she pleaded with him day
    after day, until at last he yielded to her and told her the
    real secret of his strength. He said:</p>

    <p>"I am a Nazarite, under a vow to the Lord, not to drink
    wine, and not to allow my hair to be cut. If I should let my
    hair be cut short, then the Lord would forsake me, and my
    strength would go from me, and I would be like other men."</p>

    <p>Then Delilah knew that she had found the truth at last. She
    sent for the rulers of the Philistines, saying:</p>

    <p>"Come up this once, and you shall have your enemy; for he
    has told me all that is in his heart."</p>

    <p>Then while the Philistines were watching outside, Delilah
    let Samson go to sleep, with his head upon her knees. While he
    was sound asleep, they took a razor and shaved off all his
    hair. Then she called out as at other times.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_115"
       id="Page_115"></a>Rise up, Samson, the Philistines are upon
       you."</p>

    <p>He awoke, and rose up, expecting to find himself strong as
    before; for he did not at first know that his long hair had
    been cut off. But the vow to the Lord was broken, and the Lord
    had left him. He was now as weak as other men, and helpless in
    the hands of his enemies. The Philistines easily made him their
    prisoner; and that he might never do them more harm, they put
    out his eyes. Then they chained him with fetters, and sent him
    to prison at Gaza. And in the prison they made Samson turn a
    heavy millstone to grind grain, just as though he were a beast
    of burden.</p>

    <p>But while Samson was in prison, his hair grew long again;
    and with his hair his strength came back to him; for Samson
    renewed his vow to the Lord.</p>

    <p>One day, a great feast was held by the Philistines in the
    temple of their fish-god, Dagon. For they said:</p>

    <p>"Our god has given Samson, our enemy, into our hand. Let us
    be glad together and praise Dagon."</p>

    <p>And the temple was thronged with people, and the roof over
    it was also crowded with more than three thousand men and
    women. They sent for Samson, to rejoice over him; and Samson
    <a name="Page_116"
       id="Page_116"></a>was led into the court of the temple,
       before all the people, to amuse them. After a time, Samson
       said to the boy who was leading him:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="HE_BOWED_FORWARD_WITH_ALL_HIS_MIGHT_AND_PULLED_THE_PILLARS_WITH_HIM"

        </a><br />
        <i>He bowed forward with all his might and pulled the
        pillars with him</i>
    </div>

    <p>"Take me up to the front of the temple, so that I may stand
    by one of the pillars, and lean against it."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_117"
       id="Page_117"></a>And while Samson stood between the two
       pillars, he prayed:</p>

    <p>"O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and give me strength,
    only this once, O God: and help me, that I may obtain vengeance
    upon the Philistines for my two eyes!"</p>

    <p>Then he placed one arm around the pillar on one side, and
    the other arm around the pillar on the other side; and he said:
    "Let me die with the Philistines."</p>

    <p>And he bowed forward with all his might, and pulled the
    pillars over with him, bringing down the roof and all upon it
    upon those that were under it. Samson himself was among the
    dead; but in his death he killed more of the Philistines than
    he had killed during his life.</p>

    <p>Then in the terror which came upon the Philistines the men
    of Samson's tribe came down and found his dead body, and buried
    it in their own land. After that it was years before the
    Philistines tried again to rule over the Israelites.</p>

    <p>Samson did much to set his people free; but he might have
    done much more, if he had led his people, instead of trusting
    alone to his own strength; and if he had lived more earnestly,
    and not done his deeds as though he was playing pranks. There
    were deep faults in Samson, but at the end he sought God's
    help, and found it, and God used Samson to set his people
    free.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_RUTH_THE_GLEANER"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_RUTH_THE_GLEANER"></a>THE STORY OF RUTH,
       THE GLEANER</h2>

    <p>In the time of the Judges in Israel, a man named Elimelech
    was living in the town of Bethlehem, in the tribe of Judah,
    about six miles south of Jerusalem. His wife's name was Naomi,
    and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. For some years the
    crops were poor, and food was scarce in Judah; and Elimelech
    with his family went to live in the land of Moab, which was on
    the east of the Dead Sea, as Judah was on the west.</p>

    <p>There they stayed ten years, and in that time Elimelech
    died. His two sons married women of the country of Moab, one
    named Orpah, the other named Ruth. But the two young men also
    died in the land of Moab; so that Naomi and her two
    daughters-in-law were all left widows.</p>

    <p>Naomi heard that God had again given good harvests and bread
    to the land of Judah, and she rose up to go from Moab back to
    her own land and her own town of Bethlehem. The two
    daughters-in-law loved her, and both would have gone with her,
    though the land of Judah was a strange land to them, for they
    were of the Moabite people.</p>

    <p>Naomi said to them: "Go back, my daughters,
    <a name="Page_119"
       id="Page_119"></a>to your own mothers' homes. May the Lord
       deal kindly with you, as you have been kind to your husbands
       and to me. May the Lord grant that each of you may yet find
       another husband and a happy home."</p>

    <p>Then Naomi kissed them in farewell, and the three women all
    wept together. The two young widows said to her:</p>

    <p>"You have been a good mother to us, and we will go with you,
    and live among your people."</p>

    <p>"No, no," said Naomi. "You are young, and I am old. Go back
    and be happy among your own people."</p>

    <p>Then Orpah kissed Naomi, and went back to her people; but
    Ruth would not leave her. She said:</p>

    <p>"Do not ask me to leave you, for I never will. Where you go,
    I will go; where you live, I will live; your people shall be my
    people; and your God shall be my God. Where you die, I will
    die, and be buried. Nothing but death itself shall part you and
    me."</p>

    <p>When Naomi saw that Ruth was firm in her purpose, she ceased
    trying to persuade her; so the two women went on together. They
    walked around the Dead Sea, and crossed the river Jordan, and
    climbed the mountains of Judah, and came to Bethlehem.</p>

    <p>Naomi had been absent from Bethlehem for <a name="Page_120"
       id="Page_120"></a>ten years, but her friends were all glad
       to see her again. They said:</p>

    <p>"Is this Naomi, whom we knew years ago?"</p>

    <p>Now the name Naomi means "pleasant." And Naomi said:</p>

    <p>"Call me not Naomi; call me Mara, for the Lord has made my
    life bitter. I went out full, with my husband and two sons; now
    I come home empty, without them. Do not call me 'Pleasant,'
    call me 'Bitter.'"</p>

    <p>The name "Mara," by which Naomi wished to be called means
    "bitter." But Naomi learned later that "Pleasant" was the right
    name after all.</p>

    <p>There was living in Bethlehem at that time a very rich man
    named Boaz. He owned large fields that were abundant in their
    harvests; and he was related to the family of Elimelech,
    Naomi's husband, who had died.</p>

    <p>It was the custom in Israel when they reaped the grain not
    to gather all the stalks, but to leave some for the poor
    people, who followed after the reapers with their sickles, and
    gathered what was left. When Naomi and Ruth came to Bethlehem,
    it was the time of the barley harvest; and Ruth went out into
    the fields to glean the grain which the reapers had left. It so
    happened that she was gleaning in the field that belonged to
    Boaz, this rich man.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_121"
       id="Page_121"></a>Boaz came out from the town to see his men
       reaping, and he said to them, "The Lord be with you"; and
       they answered him, "The Lord bless you."</p>

    <p>And Boaz said to his master of the reapers: "Who is this
    young woman that I see gleaning in the field?"</p>

    <p>The man answered: "It is the young woman from the land of
    Moab, who came with Naomi. She asked leave to glean after the
    reapers, and has been here gathering grain since
    yesterday."</p>

    <p>Then Boaz said to Ruth: "Listen to me, my daughter. Do not
    go to any other field, but stay here with my young women. No
    one shall harm you; and when you are thirsty, go and drink at
    our vessels of water."</p>

             </a><br />
        <i>Ruth went out into the fields to glean the grain</i>
    </div>

    <p>Then Ruth bowed to Boaz, and thanked him for his kindness,
    all the more kind because she was a stranger in Israel. Boaz
    said: "I have heard how true you have been to your
    <a name="Page_122"
       id="Page_122"></a>mother-in-law Naomi, in leaving your own
       land and coming with her to this land. May the Lord, under
       whose wings you have come, give you a reward!"</p>

    <p>And at noon, when they sat down to rest and to eat, Boaz
    gave her some of the food. And he said to the reapers:</p>

    <p>"When you are reaping, leave some of the sheaves for her;
    and drop out some sheaves from the bundles, where she may
    gather them."</p>

    <p>That evening, Ruth showed Naomi how much she had gleaned,
    and told her of the rich man Boaz, who had been so kind to her.
    And Naomi said:</p>

    <p>"This man is a near relation of ours. Stay in his fields, as
    long as the harvest lasts." And so Ruth gleaned in the fields
    of Boaz until the harvest had been gathered.</p>

    <p>At the end of the harvest, Boaz held a feast on the
    threshing-floor. And after the feast, by the advice of Naomi,
    Ruth went to him, and said to him:</p>

    <p>"You are a near relation of my husband and of his father,
    Elimelech. Now will you not do good to us for his sake?"</p>

    <p>And when Boaz saw Ruth, he loved her; and soon after this he
    took her as his wife. And Naomi and Ruth went to live in his
    home; so that Naomi's life was no more bitter, but
    pleasant.<a name="Page_123"
       id="Page_123"></a> And Boaz and Ruth had a son, whom they
       named Obed; and later Obed had a son named Jesse; and Jesse
       was the father of David, the shepherd boy who became king.
       So Ruth, the young woman of Moab, who chose the people and
       the God of Israel, became the mother of kings.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_DAVID_THE_SHEPHERD_BOY"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_DAVID_THE_SHEPHERD_BOY"></a>THE STORY OF
       DAVID, THE SHEPHERD BOY</h2>

    <p>Living at Ramah, in the mountains of Ephraim, there was a
    man whose name was Elkanah. He had two wives, as did many men
    in that time. One of these wives had children, but the other
    wife, whose name was Hannah, had no child.</p>

    <p>Every year Elkanah and his family went up to worship at the
    house of the Lord in Shiloh, which was about fifteen miles from
    his home. And at one of these visits Hannah prayed to the Lord,
    saying:</p>

    <p>"O Lord, if thou wilt look upon me, and give me a son, he
    shall be given to the Lord as long as he lives."</p>

    <p>The Lord heard Hannah's prayer, and gave her a little boy,
    and she called his name Samuel, which means "Asked of God";
    because he had been given in answer to her prayer.</p>

    <p>Samuel grew up to be a good man and a wise Judge, and he
    made his sons Judges in Israel, to help him in the care of the
    people. But Samuel's sons did not walk in his ways. They did
    not try always to do justly.</p>

    <p>The elders of all the tribes of Israel came
    to<a name="Page_125"
       id="Page_125"></a> Samuel at his home in Ramah; and they
       said to him: "You are growing old, and your sons do not rule
       as well as you ruled. All the lands around us have kings.
       Let us have a king also; and do you choose the king for
       us."</p>

    <p>This was not pleasing to Samuel. He tried to make the people
    change their minds, and showed them what trouble a king would
    bring them.</p>

    <p>But they would not follow his advice. They said: "No; we
    will have a king to reign over us."</p>

    <p>So Samuel chose as their king a tall young man named Saul,
    who was a farmer's son of the tribe of Benjamin. When Saul was
    brought before the people he stood head and shoulders above
    them all. And Samuel said:</p>

    <p>"Look at the man whom the Lord has chosen! There is not
    another like him among all the people!"</p>

    <p>And all the people shouted, "God save the king! Long live
    the king!"</p>

    <p>Then Samuel told the people what should be the laws for the
    king and for the people to obey. He wrote them down in a book,
    and placed the book before the Lord. Then Samuel sent the
    people home; and Saul went back to his own house at a place
    called Gibeah; and with Saul went a company of men to whose
    hearts God had given a love for the king.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_126"
       id="Page_126"></a>So after three hundred years under the
       fifteen Judges, Israel now had a king. But among the people
       there were some who were not pleased with the new king,
       because he was an unknown man from the farm. They said:</p>

    <p>"Can such a man as this save us?"</p>

    <p>They showed no respect to the king, and in their hearts
    looked down upon him. But Saul said nothing, and showed his
    wisdom by appearing not to notice them. But in another thing he
    was not so wise. He forgot to heed the old prophet's advice and
    instructions about ruling wisely and doing as the Lord said. It
    was not long before Samuel told him that he had disobeyed God
    and would lose his kingdom.</p>

    <p>When Samuel told Saul that the Lord would take away the
    kingdom from him, he did not mean that Saul should lose the
    kingdom at once. He was no longer God's king; and as soon as
    the right man in God's sight should be found, and should be
    trained for his duty as king, then God would take away Saul's
    power, and would give it to the man whom God had chosen. But it
    was years before this came to pass.</p>

    <p>The Lord said to Samuel: "Do not weep and mourn any longer
    over Saul, for I have refused him as king. Fill the horn with
    oil, and go to Bethlehem in Judah. There find a man named
    Jesse, for I have chosen a king among his sons."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_127"
       id="Page_127"></a>But Samuel knew that Saul would be very
       angry, if he should learn that Samuel had named any other
       man as king. He said to the Lord:</p>

    <p>"How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me."</p>

    <p>The Lord said to Samuel: "Take a young cow with you; and
    tell the people that you have come to make an offering to the
    Lord. And call Jesse and his sons to the sacrifice. I will tell
    you what to do, and you shall anoint the one whom I name to
    you."</p>

    <p>Samuel went over the mountains southward from Ramah to
    Bethlehem, about ten miles, leading a cow. The rulers of the
    town were alarmed at his coming, for they feared that he had
    come to judge the people for some evil-doing. But Samuel
    said:</p>

    <p>"I have come in peace to make an offering and to hold a
    feast to the Lord. Prepare yourselves and come to the
    sacrifice."</p>

    <p>And he invited Jesse and his sons to the service. When they
    came, he looked at the sons of Jesse very closely. The oldest
    was named Eliab, and he was so tall and noble-looking that
    Samuel thought:</p>

    <p>"Surely this young man must be the one whom God has
    chosen."</p>

    <p>But the Lord said to Samuel:</p>

    <p>"Do not look on his face, nor on the height of
    <a name="Page_128"
       id="Page_128"></a>his body, for I have not chosen him. Man
       judges by the outward looks, but God looks at the
       heart."</p>

    <p>Then Jesse's second son, named Abinadab, passed by. And the
    Lord said: "I have not chosen this one." Seven young men came
    and Samuel said:</p>

    <p>"None of these is the man whom God has chosen. Are these all
    your children?"</p>

    <p>"There is one more," said Jesse. "The youngest of all. He is
    a boy, in the field caring for the sheep."</p>

    <p>And Samuel said:</p>

    <p>"Send for him; for we will not sit down until he comes." So
    after a time the youngest son was brought in. His name was
    David, a word that means "darling," and he was a beautiful boy,
    perhaps fifteen years old, with fresh cheeks and bright
    eyes.</p>

    <p>As soon as the young David came, the Lord said to
    Samuel:</p>

    <p>"Arise, anoint him, for this is the one whom I have
    chosen."</p>

    <p>Then Samuel poured oil on David's head, in the presence of
    all his brothers. But no one knew at that time the anointing to
    mean that David was to be the king. Perhaps they thought that
    David was chosen to be a prophet like Samuel.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_129"
       id="Page_129"></a>From that time the Spirit of God came upon
       David, and he began to show signs of coming greatness. He
       went back to his sheep on the hillsides around Bethlehem,
       but God was with him.</p>

    <p>David grew up strong and brave, not afraid of the wild
    beasts which prowled around and tried to carry away his sheep.
    More than once he fought with lions, and bears, and killed
    them, when they seized the lambs of his flock. And David, alone
    all day, practiced throwing stones in a sling, until he could
    strike exactly the place for which he aimed. When he swung his
    sling, he knew that the stone would go to the very spot at
    which he was throwing it.</p>

        <i>Then Samuel poured oil on David's head</i>
    </div>

    <p>And young as he was, David thought of God,
    <a name="Page_130"
       id="Page_130"></a>and talked with God, and God talked with
       David, and showed to David His will.</p>

    <p>After Saul had disobeyed the voice of the Lord, the Spirit
    of the Lord left Saul, and no longer spoke to him. And Saul
    became very sad of heart. At times a madness would come upon
    him, and at all times he was very unhappy. The servants of Saul
    noticed that when some one played on the harp and sang, Saul's
    spirit was made more cheerful; and the sadness of soul left
    him. At one time Saul said: "Find some one who can play well,
    and bring him to me. Let me listen to music; for it drives away
    my sadness."</p>

    <p>One of the young men said: "I have seen a young man, a son
    of Jesse in Bethlehem, who can play well. He is handsome in his
    looks, and agreeable in talking. I have also heard that he is a
    brave young man, who can fight as well as he can play, and the
    Lord is with him."</p>

    <p>Then Saul sent a message to Jesse, David's father. He said:
    "Send me your son David, who is with the sheep. Let him come
    and play before me."</p>

    <p>Then David came to Saul, bringing with him a present for the
    king from Jesse. When Saul saw him, he loved him, as did
    everybody who saw the young David. And David played on the
    harp, and sang before Saul. And David's music<a name="Page_131"
       id="Page_131"></a> cheered Saul's heart, and drove away his
       sad feelings.</p>

    <p>Saul liked David so well that he made him his armorbearer;
    and David carried the shield and spear, and sword for Saul,
    when the king was before his army. But Saul did not know that
    David had been anointed by Samuel.</p>

    <p>After a time, Saul seemed well; and David returned to
    Bethlehem and was once more among his sheep in the field.
    Perhaps it was at this time that David sang his shepherd song,
    or it may have been long afterward, when David looked back in
    thought to those days when he was leading his sheep. This is
    the song, which you have heard often:</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_FIGHT_WITH_THE_GIANT"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_FIGHT_WITH_THE_GIANT"></a>THE STORY OF
       THE FIGHT WITH THE GIANT</h2>

    <p>All through the reign of Saul, there was constant war with
    the Philistines, who lived upon the lowlands west of Israel. At
    one time, when David was still with his sheep, a few years
    after he had been anointed by Samuel, the camps of the
    Philistines and the Israelites were set against each other on
    opposite sides of the valley of Elah. In the army of Israel
    were the three oldest brothers of David.</p>

    <p>Every day a giant came out of the camp of the Philistines,
    and dared some one to come from the Israelites' camp and fight
    with him. The giant's name was Goliath. He was nine feet high;
    and he wore armor from head to foot, and carried a spear twice
    as long and as heavy as any other man could hold; and his
    shield bearer walked before him. He came every day and called
    out across the little valley:</p>

    <p>"I am a Philistine, and you are servants of Saul. Now choose
    one of your men, and let him come out and fight with me. If I
    kill him; then you shall submit to us; and if he kills me, then
    we will give up to you. Come, now, send out your man!"</p>

    <p><a name="Page_133"
       id="Page_133"></a>But no man in the army, not even King
       Saul, dared to go out and fight with the giant. Forty days
       the camps stood against each other, and the Philistine giant
       continued his call.</p>

    <p>One day, old Jesse, the father of David, sent David from
    Bethlehem to visit his three brothers in the army. David came,
    and spoke to his brothers; and while he was talking with them,
    Goliath the giant came out as before in front of the camp
    calling for some one to fight with him.</p>

    <p>They said one to another:</p>

    <p>"If any man will go out and kill this Philistine, the king
    will give him a great reward and a high rank; and the king's
    daughter shall be his wife."</p>

    <p>And David said:</p>

    <p>"Who is this man that speaks in this proud manner against
    the armies of the living God? Why does not some one go out and
    kill him?"</p>

    <p>David's brother Eliab said to him:</p>

    <p>"What are you doing here, leaving your sheep in the field? I
    know that you have come down just to see the battle."</p>

    <p>But David did not care for his brother's words. He thought
    he saw a way to kill this boasting giant; and he said:</p>

    <p>"If no one else will go, I will go out and fight with this
    enemy of the Lord's people."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_134"
       id="Page_134"></a>They brought David before King Saul. Some
       years had passed since Saul had met David, and he had grown
       from a boy to a man, so that Saul did not know him as the
       shepherd who had played on the harp before him in other
       days.</p>

    <p>Saul said to David:</p>

    <p>"You cannot fight with this great giant. You are very young;
    and he is a man of war, trained from his youth."</p>

    <p>And David answered King Saul:</p>

    <p>"I am only a shepherd, but I have fought with lions and
    bears, when they have tried to steal my sheep. And I am not
    afraid to fight with this Philistine."</p>

    <p>Then Saul put his own armor on David&mdash;a helmet on his
    head, and a coat of mail on his body, and a sword at his waist.
    But Saul was almost a giant, and his armor was far too large
    for David. David said:</p>

    <p>"I am not used to fighting with such weapons as these. Let
    me fight in my own way."</p>

    <p>So David took off Saul's armor. While everybody in the army
    had been looking on the giant with fear, David had been
    thinking out the best way for fighting him; and God had given
    to David a plan. It was to throw the giant off his guard, by
    appearing weak and helpless; and while so far away that the
    giant could not reach him with sword or spear, to strike him
    down <a name="Page_135"
       id="Page_135"></a>with a weapon which the giant would not
       expect and would not be prepared for.</p>

    <p>David took his shepherd's staff in his hand, as though that
    were to be his weapon. But out of sight, in a bag under his
    mantle, he had five smooth stones carefully chosen, and a
    sling,&mdash;the weapon that he knew how to use. Then he came
    out to meet the Philistine.</p>

    <p>The giant looked down on the youth and despised him, and
    laughed.</p>

        <i>The giant looked down on the youth and despised him</i>

    <p>"Am I a dog?" he said, "that this boy comes to me with a
    staff? I will give his body to the birds of the air, and the
    beasts of the field."</p>

    <p>And the Philistine cursed David by the gods of his people.
    And David answered him:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_136"
       id="Page_136"></a>You come against me with a sword, and a
       spear, and a dart; but I come to you in the name of the Lord
       of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel. This day will the
       Lord give you into my hand. I will strike you down, and take
       off your head, and the host of the Philistines shall be dead
       bodies, to be eaten by the birds and the beasts; so that all
       may know that there is a God in Israel, and that He can save
       in other ways besides with sword and spear."</p>

             </a><br />
        <i>David drew out the giant's own sword</i>
    </div>

    <p>And David ran toward the Philistine, as if to fight him with
    his shepherd's staff. But when he was just near enough for a
    good aim, he took out his sling, and hurled a stone aimed at
    the giant's forehead. David's aim was good; the stone struck
    the Philistine in his forehead. It stunned him, and he fell to
    the ground.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_137"
       id="Page_137"></a>While the two armies stood wondering, and
       scarcely knowing what had caused the giant to fall so
       suddenly, David ran forward, drew out the giant's own sword,
       and cut off his head. Then the Philistines knew that their
       great warrior in whom they trusted was dead. They turned to
       flee to their own land; and the Israelites followed after
       them, and killed them by the hundred and the thousand, even
       to the gates of their own city of Gath.</p>

    <p>So in that day David won a great victory and stood before
    all the land as the one who had saved his people from their
    enemies.</p>

       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_CAVE_OF_ADULLAM"></a>THE STORY OF THE
       CAVE OF ADULLAM</h2>

    <p>Now Saul had a son, Jonathan, near David's own age. He and
    David became fast friends and loved one another as brothers.
    Saul the king became very jealous of David because the people
    praised him after his fight with Goliath. He even threatened to
    take David's life. He tried to catch him in his own house, but
    David's wife let him down from a window by a rope and he
    escaped. He met his friend Jonathan, who told him that he
    should flee. They renewed their promises of friendship, which
    they kept ever afterward.</p>

    <p>From his meeting with Jonathan, David went forth to be a
    wanderer, having no home as long as Saul lived. He found a
    great cave, called the cave of Adullam, and hid in it. Soon
    people heard where he was, and from all parts of the land,
    especially from his own tribe of Judah, men who were not
    satisfied with the rule of King Saul gathered around David.</p>

    <p>Saul soon heard that David, with a band of men, was hiding
    among the mountains of Judah, and that among those who aided
    him were certain priests.</p>

    <p>This enraged King Saul, and he ordered his
    <a name="Page_139"
       id="Page_139"></a>guards to kill all the priests. The guards
       would not obey him, for they felt that it was a wicked thing
       to lay hands upon the priests of the Lord.</p>

    <p>But he found one man whose name was Doeg, an Edomite, who
    was willing to obey the king. And Doeg, the Edomite, killed
    eighty-five men who wore the priestly garments.</p>

    <p>All through the land went the news of Saul's dreadful deed,
    and everywhere the people began to turn from Saul, and to look
    toward David as the only hope of the nation.</p>

    <p>When Saul died he was followed by David, the shepherd boy,
    now grown to manhood and greatly loved by the people. He had
    many battles to fight with the Philistines and was nearly
    always victorious. He was a warrior king; but he was more than
    a warrior. He played on his harp and composed many beautiful
    hymns and songs, which are collected in the book of Psalms. He
    was a good king and tried to obey God's command. He had a long
    reign and his people were happy and prosperous. He had many
    sons and daughters and beautiful palaces for them to live
    in.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_SOLOMON_AND_HIS_TEMPLE"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_SOLOMON_AND_HIS_TEMPLE"></a>THE STORY OF
       SOLOMON AND HIS TEMPLE</h2>

    <p>During the later years of David's reign, he laid up great
    treasure of gold and silver, and brass, and iron, for the
    building of a house to the Lord on Mount Moriah. This house was
    to be called "The Temple"; and it was to be made very
    beautiful, the most beautiful building, and the richest in all
    the land. David had greatly desired to build this house while
    he was king of Israel, but God said to him:</p>

    <p>"You have been a man of war, and have fought many battles,
    and shed much blood. My house shall be built by a man of peace.
    When you die, your son Solomon shall reign, and he shall have
    peace, and shall build my house."</p>

    <p>So David made ready great store of precious things for the
    temple; also stone and cedar to be used in the building. And
    David said to Solomon, his son: "God has promised that there
    shall be rest and peace to the land while you are king; and the
    Lord will be with you, and you shall build a house, where God
    shall live among His people."</p>

    <p>But David had other sons who were older than Solomon; and
    one of these sons, whose name was<a name="Page_141"
       id="Page_141"></a> Adonijah, formed a plan to make himself
       king. David was now very old; and he was no longer able to
       go out of his palace, and to be seen among the people.</p>

    <p>Adonijah gathered his friends; and among them were Joab, the
    general of the army, and Abiathar, one of the two high-priests.
    They met at a place outside the wall, and had a great feast,
    and were about to crown Adonijah as king, when word came to
    David in the palace. David, though old and feeble, was still
    wise. He said:</p>

    <p>"Let us make Solomon king at once, and thus put an end to
    the plans of these men."</p>

    <p>So at David's command they brought out the mule on which no
    one but the king was allowed to ride; and they placed Solomon
    upon it; and with the king's guards, and the nobles, and the
    great men, they brought the young Solomon down to the valley of
    Gihon, south of the city.</p>

    <p>And Zadok, the priest, took from the Tabernacle the horn
    filled with holy oil, that was used for anointing or pouring
    oil on the head of the priests when they were set apart for
    their work. He poured oil from this horn on the head of
    Solomon, and then the priests blew the trumpets, and all the
    people cried aloud, "God save King Solomon."</p>

    <p>All this time Adonijah and Joab, and their friends were not
    far away, almost in the same <a name="Page_142"
       id="Page_142"></a>valley, feasting and making merry,
       intending to make Adonijah king. They heard the sound of the
       trumpets, and the shouting of the people. Joab said: "What
       is the cause of all this noise and uproar?"</p>

    <p>A moment later, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, came running
    in. Jonathan said to the men who were feasting:</p>

    <p>"Our lord King David has made Solomon king, and he has just
    been anointed in Gihon; and all the princes, and the heads of
    the army, are with him, and the people are shouting, 'God save
    King Solomon!' And David has sent from his bed a message to
    Solomon, saying, 'May the Lord make your name greater than mine
    has been! Blessed be the Lord, who has given me a son to sit
    this day on my throne!'"</p>

    <p>When Adonijah and his friends heard this they were filled
    with fear. Every man went at once to his house, except
    Adonijah. He hastened to the altar of the Lord, and knelt
    before it, and took hold of the horns that were on its corners
    in front. This was a holy place, and he hoped that there
    Solomon might have mercy on him. And Solomon said:</p>

    <p>"If Adonijah will do right, and be faithful to me as the
    king of Israel, no harm shall come to him; but if he does
    wrong, he shall die."</p>

    <p>Then Adonijah came and bowed down before<a name="Page_143"
       id="Page_143"></a> King Solomon, and promised to obey him,
       and Solomon said, "Go to your own house."</p>

        <i>Solomon on his throne</i>
    </div>

    <p>Not long after this David sent for Solomon, and from his bed
    he gave his last advice to Solomon. And soon after that David
    died, an old man, having reigned in all forty years, seven
    years over the tribe of Judah, at Hebron, and thirty-three
    years over all Israel, in Jerusalem. He was buried in great
    honor on Mount Zion, and his tomb remained standing for many
    years.</p>

    <p>The great work of Solomon's reign was the building of the
    House of God. It was generally called the Temple. It was built
    on Mount Moriah, one of the hills of Jerusalem. King David had
    prepared for it by gathering great stores of silver, stone and
    cedar-wood. The walls were made of stone and the roof of cedar.
    Solomon had great ships which visited other lands and brought
    precious stones and fine woods for the
    building.<a name="Page_144"
       id="Page_144"></a> Seven years were spent in building the
       Temple, and it was set apart to the worship of God with
       beautiful ceremonies in which Solomon, in his robes of
       state, took part.</p>

       ELIJAH, THE PROPHET</h2>

    <p>One of the greatest of all the kings of the Ten Tribes was
    Jeroboam the second. Under him the kingdom of Israel grew rich
    and strong. He conquered nearly all Syria, and made Samaria the
    greatest city of all those lands.</p>

    <p>But though Syria went down, another nation was now rising to
    power&mdash;Assyria, on the eastern side of the river Tigris.
    Its capital was Nineveh, a great city, so vast that it would
    take three days for a man to walk around its walls. The
    Assyrians were beginning to conquer all the lands near them,
    and Israel was in danger of falling under their power.</p>

    <p>One of the kings who ruled over Israel was named Ahab. He
    provoked the anger of the Lord. His wife, Jezebel, who was a
    worshiper of Baal, persuaded him to build an altar to the false
    god.</p>

    <p>Elijah, a prophet of the Lord, was sent to him and proposed
    a test. Two altars were built; one to Jehovah and one to Baal.
    The priests of Baal called upon their god to send down fire;
    but there was no answer. Then Elijah called upon the Lord God
    of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, and fire came down and burnt up
    the offering.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_146"
       id="Page_146"></a>The people turned upon the priests of Baal
       and killed them all. Later the wicked queen, Jezebel,
       coveted a vineyard for Ahab, and she caused Naboth, the
       owner of the vineyard, to be placed in front of the battle.
       When he was slain Ahab took the vineyard.</p>

    <p>In a little while the prophet's words came true, for Ahab

    King Jehu. Elijah was taken up to heaven in a chariot of
    fire.</p>

    <p>There was another prophet, a companion of Elijah, whose name

    <p>Elisha, though weak in body, was yet strong in soul. He told
    Joash to bring him a bow and arrows, and to open the window to
    the east, looking toward the land of Syria. Then Elisha caused
    the king to draw the bow; and he placed his hands on the king's
    hands. And as the king shot an arrow, Elisha said:</p>

    <p>"This is the arrow of victory; of victory over Syria; for
    you shall smite the Syrians in Aphek and shall destroy
    them."</p>

    <p>It happened as Elisha had foretold and the Syrians were
    defeated and their cities taken.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_JONAH_AND_THE_WHALE"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_JONAH_AND_THE_WHALE"></a>THE STORY OF JONAH
       AND THE WHALE</h2>

    <p>At this time another prophet, named Jonah, was giving the
    word of the Lord to the Israelites. To Jonah the Lord spoke,
    saying:</p>

    <p>"Go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it; for its
    wickedness rises up before me."</p>

    <p>But Jonah did not wish to preach to the people of Nineveh;
    for they were the enemies of his land, the land of Israel. He
    wished Nineveh to die in its sins, and not to turn to God and
    live. So Jonah tried to go away from the city where God had
    sent him. He went down to Joppa and took a ship for
    Tarshish.</p>

    <p>But the Lord saw Jonah on the ship; and the Lord sent a
    great storm upon the sea, so that the ship seemed as though it
    would go to pieces. The sailors threw overboard everything on
    the ship; and when they could do no more, every man prayed to
    his god to save the ship and themselves. Jonah was now lying
    fast asleep, and the ship's captain came to him, and said:</p>

    <p>"What do you mean by sleeping in such a time as this? Awake,
    rise up, and call upon your God. Perhaps He will hear you and
    save our lives."</p>

    <p>But the storm continued to rage around the ship; and they
    said:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_150"
       id="Page_150"></a>There is some man on this ship who has
       brought upon us this trouble. Let us cast lots and find who
       it is."</p>

    <p>Then they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. They said to
    him, all at once:</p>

    <p>"Tell us, who are you? From what country do you come? What
    is your business? To what people do you belong? Why have you
    brought all this trouble upon us?"</p>

    <p>Then Jonah told them the whole story, how he came from the
    land of Israel, and that he had fled away from the presence of
    the Lord. And they said to him:</p>

    <p>"What shall we do to you, that the storm may cease?"</p>

    <p>Then said Jonah:</p>

    <p>"Take me up and throw me into the sea; then the storm will
    cease and the waters will be calm; for I know that for my sake
    this great tempest is upon you."</p>

    <p>But the men were not willing to throw Jonah into the sea.
    They rowed hard to bring the ship to the land, but they could
    not. Then they cried unto the Lord, and said:</p>

    <p>"We pray thee, O Lord, we pray thee, let us not die for this
    man's life; for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased
    thee."</p>

    <p>At last, when they could do nothing else to save themselves,
    they threw Jonah into the sea.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_151"
       id="Page_151"></a>At once the storm ceased, and the waves
       became still. Then the men on the ship feared the Lord
       greatly. They offered a sacrifice to the Lord, and made
       promises to serve him.</p>

    <p>And the Lord caused a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and
    Jonah was alive within the fish for three days and three
    nights. In the fish Jonah cried to the Lord; and the Lord
    caused the great fish to throw up Jonah upon the dry land.</p>

    <p>Notice all through this story that, although Jonah was God's
    servant, he was always thinking about himself. God protected
    Jonah and saved him, not because he was such a good man, but
    because he wanted to teach him a great lesson.</p>

    <p>By this time Jonah had learned that some men who worshipped
    idols were kind in their hearts, and were dear to the Lord.
    This was the lesson that God meant Jonah to learn; and now the
    call of the Lord came to Jonah a second time:</p>

    <p>"Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it
    what I command you." So Jonah went to the city of Nineveh; and
    as he entered into it, he called out to the people:</p>

    <p>"Within forty days shall Nineveh be destroyed."</p>

    <p>And he walked through the city all day crying out only
    this:</p>

    <p>"Within forty days shall Nineveh be destroyed."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_152"
       id="Page_152"></a>And the people of Nineveh believed the
       word of the Lord as spoken by Jonah. They turned away from
       their sins and fasted and sought the Lord, from the greatest
       of them even to the least. The king of Nineveh arose from
       his throne, and laid aside his royal robes, and covered
       himself with sack-cloth and sat in ashes, as a sign of his
       sorrow. And the king sent out a command to his people that
       they should fast, and seek the Lord, and turn from sin.</p>

        <i>To shade Jonah from the sun</i>
    </div>

    <p>And God saw that the people of Nineveh were sorry for their
    wickedness, and he forgave them, and did not destroy their
    city. But this made Jonah very angry. He did not wish to have
    Nineveh spared, because it was the enemy of his own land; and
    also he feared that men would call him a false prophet when his
    word did not come to pass. And Jonah said to the Lord:</p>

    <p>"O Lord, I was sure that it would be thus, that thou
    wouldest spare the city; and for that reason I tried to flee
    away; for I know that thou <a name="Page_153"
       id="Page_153"></a>wast a gracious God, full of pity, slow to
       anger, and rich in mercy. Now, O Lord, take away my life,
       for it is better for me to die than to live."</p>

    <p>And Jonah went out of the city, and built a little hut on
    the east side of it, and sat under its roof, to see whether God
    would keep the word that he had spoken. Then the Lord caused a
    plant with thick leaves to grow up, and to shade Jonah from the
    sun; and Jonah was glad, and sat under its shadow. But a worm
    destroyed the plant; and the next day a hot wind blew, and
    Jonah suffered from the heat; and again Jonah wished that he
    might die. And the Lord said to Jonah:</p>

    <p>"You were sorry to see the plant die, though you did not
    make it grow, and though it came up in a night and died in a
    night. And should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city,
    where are more than a hundred thousand little children, and
    also many cattle,&mdash;all helpless and knowing nothing?"</p>

    <p>And Jonah learned that men, and women, and little children,
    are all precious in the sight of the Lord, even though they
    know not God.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_FIERY_FURNACE"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_FIERY_FURNACE"></a>THE STORY OF THE
       FIERY FURNACE</h2>

    <p>There was in the land of Judah a wicked king-named
    Jehoiakim, son of the good Josiah. While Jehoiakim was ruling
    over the land of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, a great conqueror of
    the nations, came from Babylon with his army of Chaldean
    soldiers. He took the city of Jerusalem, and made Jehoiakim
    promise to submit to him as his master. And when he went back
    to his own land he took with him all the gold and silver that
    he could find in the Temple; and he carried away as captives
    very many of the princes and nobles, the best people in the
    land of Judah.</p>

    <p>When these Jews were brought to the land of Chaldea or
    Babylon, King Nebuchadnezzar gave orders to the prince, who had
    charge of his palace, to choose among these Jewish captives
    some young men who were of noble rank, and beautiful in their
    looks, and also quick and bright in their minds; young men who
    would be able to learn readily. These young men were to be
    placed under the care of wise men, who should teach them all
    that they knew, and fit them to stand before the king of
    Babylon, so that they might be his helpers to carry out his
    <a name="Page_155"
       id="Page_155"></a>orders; and the king wished them to be
       wise, so that they might give him advice in ruling his
       people.</p>

    <p>Among the young men thus chosen were four Jews, men who had
    been brought from Judah. By order of the king the names of
    these men were changed. One of them, named Daniel, was to be
    called Belteshazzer; the other three young men were called
    Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. They were taught in all the
    knowledge of the Chaldeans; and after three years of training
    they were taken into the king's palace.</p>

    <p>King Nebuchadnezzar was pleased with them, more than with
    any others who stood before him. He found them wise and
    faithful in the work given to them, and able to rule over men
    under them. And these four men came to the highest places in
    the kingdom of the Chaldeans.</p>

    <p>At one time King Nebuchadnezzar caused a great image to be
    made, and to be covered with gold. This image he set up, as an
    idol to be worshipped, on the plain of Dura, near the city of
    Babylon. When it was finished, it stood upon its base or
    foundation almost a hundred feet high; so that upon the plain
    it could be seen far away. Then the king sent out a command for
    all the princes, and rulers, and nobles in the land, to come to
    a great gathering, when the image was to be set apart for
    worship.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_156"
       id="Page_156"></a>The great men of the kingdom came from far
       and near and stood around the image. Among them, by command
       of the king, were Daniel's three friends, the young Jews,
       Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. For some reason, Daniel
       himself was not there. He may have been busy with the work
       of the kingdom in some other place.</p>

    <p>At one moment in the service before the image, all the
    trumpets sounded, the drums were beaten, and music was made
    upon musical instruments of all kinds, as a signal for all the
    people to kneel down and worship the great golden image. But
    while the people were kneeling, there were three men who stood
    up, and would not bow down. These were the three young Jews,
    Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. They knelt down before the
    Lord God only.</p>

    <p>Many of the nobles had been jealous of these young men,
    because they had been lifted to high places in the rule of the
    kingdom; and these men who hated Daniel and his friends, were
    glad to find that these three men had not obeyed the command of
    King Nebuchadnezzar. The king had said that if any one did not
    worship the golden image he should be thrown into a furnace of
    fire. These men who hated the Jews came to the king and
    said:</p>

    <p>"O king, may you live for ever! You gave <a name="Page_157"
       id="Page_157"></a>orders that when the music sounded, every
       one should bow down and worship the golden image; and that
       if any man did not worship, he should be thrown into a
       furnace of fire. There are some Jews, whom you have made
       rulers in the land, who have not done as you commanded.
       Their names are Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. They do not
       serve your gods, nor worship the golden image that you have
       set up."</p>

        <i>Nebuchadnezzar was fitted with rage</i>
    </div>

    <p>Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage and fury at knowing
    that any one should dare to disobey his words. He sent for
    these three men and said to them:</p>

    <p>"O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, was it by purpose that
    you did not fall down and <a name="Page_158"
       id="Page_158"></a>worship the image of gold? The music shall
       sound once more, and if you then will worship the image, it
       will be well. But if you will not, then you shall be thrown
       into the furnace of fire, to die."</p>

    <p>These three young men were not afraid of the king. They
    said:</p>

    <p>"O King Nebuchadnezzar, we are ready to answer you at once.
    The God whom we serve is able to save us from the fiery
    furnace, and we know that he will save us. But if it is God's
    will that we should die, even then you may understand, O king,
    that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden
    image."</p>

    <p>This answer made the king more furious than before. He said
    to his servants:</p>

    <p>"Make a fire in the furnace hotter than ever it has been
    before, as hot as fire can be made; and throw these three men
    into it."</p>

    <p>Then the soldiers of the king's army seized the three young
    Jews, as they stood in their loose robes, with their turbans on
    their heads. They tied them with ropes, and dragged them to the
    mouth of the furnace, and threw them into the fire. The flames
    rushed from the opened door with such fury that they burned
    even to death the soldiers who were holding these men; and the
    men themselves fell down bound into the middle of the fiery
    furnace.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_159"
       id="Page_159"></a>But an angel befriended them and they were
       unhurt.</p>

        <i>An angel befriended them</i>
    </div>

    <p>King Nebuchadnezzar stood in front of the furnace, and
    looked into the open door. As he looked, he was filled with
    wonder at what he saw; and he said to the nobles around
    him:</p>

    <p>"Did we not throw three men bound into the
    <a name="Page_160"
       id="Page_160"></a>fire? How is it then that I see four men
       loose walking in the furnace; and the fourth man looks as
       though he were a son of the gods?"</p>

    <p>And the nobles who stood by could scarcely speak, so great
    was their surprise.</p>

    <p>"It is true, O king," at last they said to Nebuchadnezzar,
    "that we cast these men into the flames, expecting them to be
    burned up; and we cannot understand how it happens that they
    have not been destroyed."</p>

    <p>The king came near to the door of the furnace, as the fire
    became lower; and he called out to the three men within it:</p>

    <p>"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye who serve the Most
    High God, come out of the fire, and come to me."</p>

    <p>They came out and stood before the king, in the sight of all
    the princes, and nobles, and rulers; and every one could see
    that they were alive.</p>

    <p>Their garments had not been scorched, nor their hair singed,
    nor was there even the smell of fire upon them.</p>

    <p>Then King Nebuchadnezzar said before all his rulers:</p>

    <p>"Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who
    has sent his angel, and has saved the lives of these men who
    trusted in him. <i>I</i> make a law that no man in all my
    kingdoms <a name="Page_161"
       id="Page_161"></a>shall say a word against their God, for
       there is no other god who can save in this manner those who
       worship him. And if any man speaks a word against their God,
       the Most High God, that man shall be cut in pieces, and his
       house shall be torn down."</p>

    <p>After King Nebuchadnezzar died, his kingdom became weak, and
    the city of Babylon was taken by the Medes and Persians, under
    Cyrus, a great warrior.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_DANIEL_IN_THE_LIONS_DEN"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_DANIEL_IN_THE_LIONS_DEN"></a>THE STORY OF
       DANIEL IN THE LIONS' DEN</h2>

    <p>The lands which had been the Babylonian or Chaldean empire,
    now became the empire of Persia; and over these Darius was the
    king. King Darius gave to Daniel, who was now a very old man, a
    high place in honor and in power. Among all the rulers over the
    land, Daniel stood first, for the king saw that he was wise and
    able to rule. This made the other princes and rulers very
    jealous, and they tried to find something evil in Daniel, so
    that they could speak to the king against him.</p>

    <p>These men saw that three times every day Daniel went to his
    room and opened the window that was toward the city of
    Jerusalem, and looking toward Jerusalem, made his prayer to
    God. Jerusalem was at that time in ruins, and the Temple was no
    longer standing; but Daniel prayed three times each day with
    his face toward the place where the house of God had once
    stood, although it was many hundreds of miles away.</p>

    <p>These nobles thought that in Daniel's prayers they could
    find a chance to do him harm, and perhaps cause him to be put
    to death. They came to King Darius, and said to him:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_163"
       id="Page_163"></a>All the rulers have agreed together to
       have a law made that for thirty days no one shall ask
       anything of any god or of any man, except from you, O king;
       and that if any one shall pray to any god, or shall ask
       anything from any man during the thirty days, except from
       you, O king, he shall be thrown into the den where the lions
       are kept. Now, O king, make the law, and sign the writing,
       so that it cannot be changed, for no law among the Medes and
       the Persians can be altered."</p>

    <p>The king was not a wise man; and being foolish and vain, he
    was pleased with this law which would set him even above the
    gods. So without asking Daniel's advice, he signed the writing;
    and the law was made, and the word was sent out through the
    kingdom, that for thirty days no one should pray to any
    god.</p>

    <p>Daniel knew that the law had been made, but every day he
    went to his room three times, and opened the window that looked
    toward Jerusalem, and offered his prayers to the Lord, just as
    he had prayed in other times. These rulers were watching near
    by, and they saw Daniel kneeling in prayer to God. Then they
    came to the king, and said:</p>

    <p>"O King Darius, have you not made a law, that if any one in
    thirty days offers a prayer, he shall be thrown into the den of
    lions?"</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_164"
       id="Page_164"></a>It is true," said the king. "The law has
       been made, and it must stand."</p>

    <p>They said to the king: "There is one man who does not obey
    the law which you have made. It is that Daniel, one of the
    captive Jews. Every day Daniel prays to his God three times,
    just as he did before you signed the writing of the law."</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="THROWN_INTO_THE_DEN_OF_LIONS"

        <i>Thrown into the den of lions</i>
    </div>

    <p>Then the king was very sorry for what he had done, for he
    loved Daniel, and knew that no one could take his place in the
    kingdom. All day, until the sun went down, he tried in vain to
    find some way to save Daniel's life; but when evening came,
    these men again told him of the law that he had made, and said
    to him that it must be kept. Very unwillingly the king sent for
    Daniel, and gave an order that he should be thrown into the den
    of lions. He said to Daniel:<a name="Page_165"
       id="Page_165"></a> "Perhaps your God, whom you serve so
       faithfully, will save you from the lions."</p>

    <p>They led Daniel to the mouth of the pit where the lions were
    kept, and they threw him in; and over the mouth they placed a
    stone; and the king sealed it with his own seal, and with the
    seals of his nobles; so that no one might take away the stone
    and let Daniel out of the den.</p>

    <p>Then the king went again to his palace; but that night he
    was so sad that he could not eat, nor did he listen to music as
    he was used to listen. He could not sleep, for all through the
    night he was thinking of Daniel. Very early in the morning he
    rose up from his bed and went in haste to the den of lions. He
    broke the seal and took away the stone, and in a voice full of
    sorrow he called out, scarcely hoping to have an answer:</p>

    <p>"O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God been able
    to save you from the lions?"</p>

    <p>And out of the darkness in the den came the voice of Daniel,
    saying:</p>

    <p>"O king, may you live forever! My God has sent his angel and
    has shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me,
    because my God saw that I had done no wrong. And I have done no
    wrong toward you, O king!"</p>

        <p><b>DANIEL'S ANSWER TO THE KING</b>&mdash;Then said
        Daniel unto the King, O King, live forever. My God hath
        sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they
        have not hurt me.&mdash;(Daniel 6: 21-22.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Then the king was glad. He gave to his servants orders to
    take Daniel out of the den. Daniel <a name="Page_166"
       id="Page_166"></a><a name="Page_167"
       id="Page_167"></a>was brought out safe and without harm,
       because he had trusted fully in the Lord God. Then by the
       king's command, they brought those men who had spoken
       against Daniel, and with them their wives and their
       children, for the king was exceedingly angry with them. They
       were all thrown into the den, and the hungry lions leaped
       upon them, and tore them in pieces, so soon as they fell
       upon the floor of the den.</p>

    <p>After this king Darius wrote to all the lands and the
    peoples in the many kingdoms under his rule:</p>

    <p>"May peace be given to you all abundantly! I make a law that
    everywhere among my kingdoms men fear and worship the Lord God
    of Daniel; for he is the living God, above all other gods, who
    only can save men."</p>

    <p>And Daniel stood beside king Darius until the end of his
    reign, and afterward while Cyrus the Persian was king over all
    the lands.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_ANGEL_BY_THE_ALTAR"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_ANGEL_BY_THE_ALTAR"></a>THE STORY OF
       THE ANGEL BY THE ALTAR</h2>

    <p>At the time when the story of the New Testament begins, the
    land of Israel, called also the land of Judea, was ruled by a
    king named Herod. He was the first of several Herods, who at
    different times ruled either the whole of the land, or parts of
    it. But Herod was not the highest ruler. Many years before this
    time, the Romans, who came from the city of Rome in Italy, had
    won all the lands around the Great Sea, the sea which we call
    the Mediterranean; and above king Herod of Judea was the great
    king of Rome, ruling over all the lands, and over the land of
    Judea among them. So Herod, though king of Judea, obeyed his
    overlord, the emperor at Rome. At the time when this story
    begins, the emperor at Rome was named Augustus Csar.</p>

    <p>At this time, the land where the Jews lived was full of
    people. Jerusalem was its largest city, and in Jerusalem was
    standing the Temple of the Lord, which king Herod had lately
    built anew, taking the place of the old Temple built very many
    years before, which had long needed repair. There were also
    many other <a name="Page_169"
       id="Page_169"></a>large cities besides Jerusalem. In the
       south was Hebron among the mountains; on the shore of the
       Great Sea were Gaza, and Joppa, and Csarea; in the middle
       of the land were Shechem and Samaria; and in the north were
       Nazareth, and Cana; down by the shore of the Sea of Galilee
       were Tiberias, and Capernaum, and Bethsaida. Far up in the
       north, at the foot of snowy Mount Hermon, was another
       Csarea; but so that it might not be confused with Csarea
       upon the seacoast this city was called Csarea-Philippi, or
       "Philip's Csarea," from the name of one of Herod's
       sons.</p>

    <p>One day, an old priest named Zacharias was leading the
    service of worship in the Temple. He was standing in front of
    the golden altar of incense, in the Holy Place, and was holding
    in his hand a censer, or cup, full of burning coals and
    incense; while all the people were worshipping in the court of
    the Temple, outside the court of the Priests, where the great
    altar of burnt-offering stood.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, Zacharias saw an angel from the Lord, standing on
    the right side of the altar of incense. He felt a great fear
    when he saw this strange being with shining face; but the angel
    said to him:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="DO_NOT_BE_AFRAID_ZACHARIAS"
             id="DO_NOT_BE_AFRAID_ZACHARIAS"><img src="./images/figure45_th.jpg"
             title="Do not be afraid, Zacharias"
             alt="Do not be afraid, Zacharias" /></a><br />
        <i>"Do not be afraid, Zacharias"</i>
    </div>

    <p>"Do not be afraid, Zacharias; for I have come from the Lord
    to bring good news. Your wife<a name="Page_170"
       id="Page_170"></a> Elizabeth shall have a son, and you shall
       name him John. You shall be made glad, for your son John
       shall bring joy and gladness to many. He shall be great in
       the sight of the Lord; and he shall never taste wine nor
       strong drink as long as he lives; but he shall be filled
       with God's Holy<a name="Page_171"
       id="Page_171"></a> Spirit. He shall lead many of the people
       of Israel to the Lord, for he shall go before the Lord in
       the power of Elijah the prophet, as was promised by Malachi,
       the last of the old prophets. He shall turn the hearts of
       the fathers to the children, and those who are disobeying
       the Lord to do his will."</p>

    <p>As Zacharias heard these words, he was filled with wonder,
    and could hardly believe them true. He was now an old man, and
    his wife Elizabeth was also old; so that they could not expect
    to have a child. He said to the angel:</p>

    <p>"How shall I know that your words are true, for I am an old
    man, and my wife is old?"</p>

    <p>"I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God," said the
    angel. "And I was sent from the Lord to speak to you, and to
    bring you this good news. But because you did not believe my
    words, you shall become dumb, and shall not be able to speak,
    until this which I have said comes to pass."</p>

    <p>All this time the people outside in the court were wondering
    why the priest stayed so long in the Temple. When at last he
    came out, they found that he could not speak a word; but he
    made signs to them, to tell them that he had seen a vision in
    the Temple.</p>

    <p>After the days of his service were over, Zacharias went to
    his own home, which was near<a name="Page_172"
       id="Page_172"></a> Hebron, a city of the priests, among the
       mountains in the south of Judea. When his wife Elizabeth
       found that God was soon to give her a child, she was very
       happy, and praised the Lord.</p>

    <p>About six months after Zacharias saw the vision in the
    Temple, the same angel Gabriel was sent from the Lord to a city
    in the part of the land called Galilee, which was in the north.
    The city to which the angel was sent was Nazareth. There the
    angel found a young girl named Mary, who was a cousin to
    Elizabeth. Mary was soon to be married to a good man who had
    sprung from the line of king David, though he was not himself a
    king, nor a rich man. He was a carpenter, living in Nazareth,
    and his name was Joseph. The angel came into the room where
    Mary was, and said to her: "Hail, woman favored by the Lord;
    the Lord is with you!"</p>

    <p>Mary was surprised at the angel's words, and wondered what
    they could mean. Then the angel spoke again, and said: "Do not
    be afraid, Mary. The Lord has given to you his favor, and has
    chosen you to be the mother of a son whose name shall be Jesus,
    which means 'salvation,' because he shall save his people from
    their sins. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of
    God; and the Lord shall give to him the throne of his father
    David. He shall be a king, and <a name="Page_173"
       id="Page_173"></a>shall reign over the people of God
       forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end."</p>

    <p>But Mary could not see how all this was to come to pass. And
    the angel said to her:</p>

    <p>"The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the
    Most High God shall be over you; and the child which you shall
    have shall be called holy, the Son of God."</p>

    <p>Then the angel told Mary that her cousin Elizabeth was soon
    to have a child, through the power of the Lord. And when Mary
    heard all this, she said: "I am the servant of the Lord, to do
    his will. Let it be to me as you have said."</p>

    <p>When the angel had given his message and had gone away, Mary
    rose up in haste and made a journey to the home of Zacharias
    and Elizabeth. When Elizabeth saw Mary, she was filled with the
    Spirit of the Lord, and said:</p>

    <p>"Blessed are you among women, and blessed among men shall be
    your son! And why is it that the mother of my Lord comes to
    visit me? Blessed is the woman who believed that the promise of
    the Lord to her shall be made true!"</p>

    <p>Then Mary was filled with the Spirit of the Lord, and broke
    out into a song of praise. She stayed with Elizabeth for nearly
    three months, and then went again to her own home at
    Nazareth.</p>

    <p>As the angel had said, to the aged woman<a name="Page_174"
       id="Page_174"></a> Elizabeth was given a son. They were
       going to name him Zacharias, after his father. But his
       mother said: "No, his name shall be John."</p>

    <p>"Why," they said, "none of your family have ever been named
    John!"</p>

    <p>They asked his father Zacharias, by signs, what name he
    wished to be given to the child. He asked for something to
    write upon; and when they brought it, he wrote, "His name is
    John." Then all at once, the power to hear and to speak came
    back to Zacharias. He spoke, praising and blessing God; and he
    sang a song of thanks to God, in which he said:</p>

    <p>"You O child, shall be called a prophet of the Most High; to
    go before the Lord, and to make ready his ways."</p>

    <p>When John was growing up, they sent him out into the desert
    on the south of the land, and there he stayed until the time
    came for him to preach to the people; for this child became the
    great prophet John the Baptist.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_JESUS_THE_BABE_OF_BETHLEHEM"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_JESUS_THE_BABE_OF_BETHLEHEM"></a>THE STORY
       OF JESUS, THE BABE OF BETHLEHEM</h2>

    <p>Soon after the time when John the Baptist was born, Joseph
    the carpenter of Nazareth had a dream. In his dream he saw an
    angel from the Lord standing beside him. The angel said to
    him:</p>

    <p>"Joseph, sprung from the line of king David, I have come to
    tell you, that Mary, the young woman whom you are to marry,
    will have a son, sent by the Lord God. You shall call his name
    Jesus, which means 'salvation,' because he shall save his
    people from their sins."</p>

    <p>God's people had had several kings. Some of them had been
    selfish and cruel, but Jesus was to be a new kind of king, one
    who would save, not destroy men.</p>

    <p>Soon after Joseph and Mary were married in Nazareth, a
    command went forth from the emperor Augustus Csar through all
    the lands of the Roman empire, for all the people to go to the
    cities and towns from which their families had come, and there
    to have their names written down upon a list, for the emperor
    wished a list to be made of all the people under his rule. As
    both Joseph and Mary had come from the family
    <a name="Page_176"
       id="Page_176"></a>of David the king, they went together from
       Nazareth to Bethlehem, there to have their names written
       upon the list. For you remember that Bethlehem in Judea, six
       miles south of Jerusalem, was the place where David was
       born, and where his father's family had lived for many
       years.</p>

    <p>It was a long journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem; down the
    mountains to the river Jordan, then following the Jordan almost
    to its end, and then climbing the mountains of Judah to the
    town of Bethlehem. When Joseph and Mary came to Bethlehem they
    found the city full of people who, like themselves, had come to
    have their names enrolled or written upon the list. The inn or
    hotel was full, and there was no room for them; for no one but
    themselves knew that this young woman was soon to be the mother
    of the Lord of all the earth. The best that they could do was
    to go to a stable where the cattle were kept. There the little
    baby was born, and was laid in a manger, where the cattle were
    fed.</p>

    <p>On that night, some shepherds were tending their sheep in a
    field near Bethlehem. Suddenly, a great light shone upon them,
    and they saw an angel of the Lord standing before them. They
    were filled with fear, as they saw how glorious the angel was.
    But the angel said to them:</p>

    <p>"Be not afraid; for behold I bring you news of
    <a name="Page_177"
       id="Page_177"></a>great joy, which shall be to all the
       people; for there is born to you this day in Bethlehem, the
       city of David, a Saviour who is Christ the Lord, the
       anointed king. You may see him there; and you may know him
       by this sign: He is a new-born baby, lying in a manger, at
       the inn."</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="THEY_WERE_FILLED_WITH_FEAR"

             alt="They were filled with fear" /></a><br />
        <i>They were filled with fear</i>
    </div>

    <p>And then they saw that the air around and the sky above them
    were filled with angels, praising God and singing:</p>

    <p>"Glory to God in the highest. And on earth peace among men
    in whom God is well pleased."</p>

    <p>While they looked with wonder, and listened,
    <a name="Page_178"
       id="Page_178"></a>the angels went out of sight as suddenly
       as they had come. Then the shepherds said one to
       another:</p>

    <p>"Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see this wonderful
    thing that has come to pass, and which the Lord has made known
    to us."</p>

             alt="The baby in the manger" /></a><br />
        <i>The baby in the manger</i>
    </div>

    <p>Then as quickly as they could go to Bethlehem, they went,
    and found Joseph, the carpenter of<a name="Page_179"
       id="Page_179"></a> Nazareth, and his young wife Mary, and
       the little baby lying in the manger. They told Mary and
       Joseph, and others also, how they had seen the angels, and
       what they had heard about this baby. All who heard their
       story wondered at it; Mary, the mother of the child, said
       nothing. She thought over all these things, and silently
       kept them in her heart. After their visit, the shepherds
       went back to their flocks, praising God for the good news
       that he had sent to them.</p>

    <p>When the little one was eight days old, they gave him a
    name; and the name given was "Jesus," a word which means
    "salvation," as the angel had told both Mary and Joseph that he
    should be named. So the very name of this child told what he
    should do for men; for he was to bring salvation to the
    world.<a name="Page_180"

       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_STAR_AND_THE_WISE_MEN"></a>THE STORY OF
       THE STAR AND THE WISE MEN</h2>

    <p>For some time after Jesus was born, Joseph and Mary stayed
    with him in Bethlehem. The little baby was not kept long in the
    stable sleeping in a manger; for after a few days they found
    room in a house; and there another visit was made to Jesus by
    strange men from a land far away.</p>

    <p>In a country east of Judea, and many miles distant, were
    living some very wise men who studied the stars. One night they
    saw a strange star shining in the sky, and in some way they
    learned that the coming of this star meant that a king was soon
    to be born in the land of Judea. These men felt a call of God
    to go to Judea, far to the west of their own home, and there to
    see this new-born king. They took a long journey, with camels
    and horses, and at last they came to, the land of Judea, just
    at the time when Jesus was born at Bethlehem. As soon as they
    were in Judea, they supposed that every one would know all
    about the king, and they said:</p>

    <p>"Where is he that is born king of the Jews? In the east we
    have seen his star, and we have come to worship him."</p>

        <p><b>THE SHEPHERDS IN THE FIELD</b>&mdash;And there were
        in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping
        watch over their flock by night.... And the angel said unto
        them, 'Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of
        great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is
        born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is
        Christ the Lord.'&mdash;(Luke 2: 8-10-11.)</p>
    </div>

    <p><a name="Page_182"
       id="Page_182"></a>But no one of whom they asked had ever
       seen this king, or had heard of him. The news of their
       coming was sent to Herod the king, who was now a very old
       man. He ruled the land of Judea, as you know, under the
       emperor at Rome, Augustus Csar. Herod was a very wicked
       man, and when he heard of some one born to be a king, he
       feared that he might lose his own kingdom. He made up his
       mind to kill this new king.</p>

    <p>He sent for the priests and scribes, the men who studied and
    taught the books of the Old Testament, and asked them about
    this Christ for whom all the people were looking. He said: "Can
    you tell me where Christ, the king of Israel, is to be born?"
    They looked at the books of the prophets, and then they said:
    "He is to be born in Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it is written
    by the prophet, 'And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are
    not the least among the princes of Judah; for out of thee shall
    come forth one who shall rule my people Israel.'"</p>

    <p>Then Herod sent for the wise men from the east, and met them
    alone, and found from them at what time the star was first
    seen. Then he said to them:</p>

    <p>"Go to Bethlehem; and there search carefully for the little
    child; and when you have found him, bring me word again, so
    that I also may come and worship him."</p>

    <p>Then the wise men went on their way toward Bethlehem; and
    suddenly they saw the star again shining upon the road before
    them. At this they were glad, and followed the star until it
    led them to the very house where the little child was. They
    came in, and there they saw the little one, with Mary, its
    mother. They knew at once that this was the king; and they fell
    down <a name="Page_184"
       id="Page_184"></a>on their faces and worshipped him as the
       Lord. Then they brought out gifts of gold and precious
       perfumes, frankincense and myrrh, which were used in
       offering sacrifices; and they gave them as presents to the
       royal child.</p>

    <p>That night God sent a dream to the wise men, telling them
    not to go back to Herod, but to go home at once to their own
    land by another way. They obeyed the Lord, and found another
    road to their own country without passing through Jerusalem
    where Herod was living. So Herod could not learn from those men
    who the child was that was born to be a king.</p>

    <p>And very soon after these wise men had gone away, the Lord
    sent another dream to Joseph, the husband of Mary. He saw an
    angel, who spoke to him, saying:</p>

    <p>"Rise up quickly; take the little child and his mother, and
    go down to the land of Egypt, for Herod will try to find the
    child to kill him."</p>

    <p>Then at once Joseph rose up in the night, without waiting
    even for the morning. He took his wife and her baby, and
    quietly and quickly went with them down to Egypt, which was on
    the southwest of Judea. There they all stayed in safety, as
    long as the wicked king Herod lived, which was not many
    months.</p>

    <p>King Herod waited for the wise men to come back to him from
    their visit to Bethlehem; but <a name="Page_185"
       id="Page_185"></a>he soon found that they had gone to their
       home without bringing to him any word. Then Herod was very
       angry. He sent out his soldiers to Bethlehem. They came, and
       by the cruel king's <a name="Page_186"
       id="Page_186"></a>command they seized all the little
       children in Bethlehem who were three years old, or younger,
       and killed them all. What a cry went up to God from the
       mothers in Bethlehem, as their children were torn from their
       arms and slain!</p>

        <i>He took his wife and baby and went down to Egypt</i>
    </div>

    <p>But all this time, the child Jesus whom they were seeking
    was safe with his mother in the land of Egypt.</p>

    <p>Soon after this king Herod died, a very old man, cruel to
    the last. Then the angel of the Lord came again and spoke to
    Joseph in a dream, saying: "You may now take the young child
    back to his own land, for the king who sought to kill him is
    dead."</p>

    <p>Then Joseph took his wife and the little child Jesus, and
    started to go again to the land of Judea. Perhaps it was his
    thought to go again to Bethlehem, the city of David, and there
    bring up the child. But he heard that in that part of the land
    Archelaus, a son of Herod, was now ruling, and who was as
    wicked and cruel as his father.</p>

    <p>He feared to go under Archelaus' rule, and instead took his
    wife and the child to Nazareth, which had been his own home and
    that of Mary his wife before the child was born. Nazareth was
    in the part of the land called Galilee, which at that time was
    ruled by another son of king Herod, a king named Herod Antipas.
    He was <a name="Page_187"
       id="Page_187"></a>not a good man, but was not so cruel nor
       bloody as his wicked father had been.</p>

    <p>So again Joseph the carpenter and Mary his wife were living
    in Nazareth. And there they stayed for many years while Jesus
    was growing up. Jesus was not the only child in their house,
    and he had many other playmates among the boys of
    Nazareth.<a name="Page_188"

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_CHILD_IN_THE_TEMPLE"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_CHILD_IN_THE_TEMPLE"></a>THE STORY OF
       THE CHILD IN THE TEMPLE</h2>

    <p>Jesus was brought to Nazareth when he was a little child not
    more than three years old; there he grew up as a boy and a
    young man, and there he lived until he was thirty years of age.
    We should like to know many things about his boyhood, but the
    Bible tells us very little. As Joseph was a working man, it is
    likely that he lived in a house with only one room, with no
    floor except the earth, no window except a hole in the wall, no
    pictures upon the walls, and neither bedstead, nor chair, nor
    looking-glass. They sat upon the floor or upon cushions; they
    slept upon rolls of matting, and their meals were taken from a
    low table not much larger than a stool.</p>

    <p>Jesus may have learned to read at the village school, which
    was generally held in the house used for worship, called the
    "synagogue." The lessons were from rolls on which were written
    parts of the Old Testament; but Jesus never had a Bible of his
    own. From a child he went with Joseph to the worship in the
    synagogue twice every week. There they sat on the floor and
    heard the Old Testament read and explained, <a name="Page_189"
       id="Page_189"></a>while Mary and the younger sisters of
       Jesus listened from a gallery behind a lattice-screen. The
       Jewish boys of that time were taught to know almost the
       whole of the Old Testament by heart.</p>

    <p>It was the custom of the Jews from all parts of the land to
    go up to Jerusalem to worship at least once every year, at the
    feast of the Passover, which was held in the spring. Some
    families also stayed to the feast of Pentecost, which was fifty
    days after Passover; and some went again in the fall to the
    feast of Tabernacles, when for a week all the families slept
    out of doors, under roofs made of green twigs and bushes.</p>

    <p>When Jesus was a boy twelve years old, he was taken up to
    the feast of the Passover, and there for the first time he saw
    the holy city Jerusalem, and the Temple of the Lord on Mount
    Moriah. Young as he was, his soul was stirred, as he walked
    among the courts of the Temple and saw the altar with its
    smoking sacrifice, the priests in their white robes, and the
    Levites with their silver trumpets. Though a boy, Jesus began
    to feel that he was the Son of God, and that this was his
    Father's house.</p>

        <i>Sitting in a company of the doctors of the law</i>
    </div>

    <p>His heart was so filled with the worship of the Temple, with
    the words of the scribes or teachers whom he heard in the
    courts, and with his own <a name="Page_190"
       id="Page_190"></a>thoughts, that when it was time to go home
       to Nazareth, he stayed behind, held fast by his love for the
       house of the Lord. The company of people who were traveling
       together was large, and at first he was not missed. But when
       night came and the boy Jesus could not be found, his mother
       was alarmed. The next day Joseph and Mary left their company
       and hastened back to Jerusalem. They did not at first think
       to go to the Temple. They sought him among their friends and
       kindred who were living in the city, but could not find
       him.</p>

    <p>On the third day, they went up to the Temple with heavy
    hearts, still looking for their boy. And there they found him
    sitting in a company <a name="Page_191"
       id="Page_191"></a>of the doctors of the law, listening to
       their words and asking them questions. Everybody who stood
       near was surprised to find how deep was the knowledge of
       this boy in the word of the Lord.</p>

    <p>His mother spoke to him a little sharply, for she felt that
    her son had not been thoughtful of his duty. She said: "Child,
    why have you treated us in this way? Do you not know that your
    father and I have been looking for you with troubled
    hearts?"</p>

    <p>"Why did you seek for me," said Jesus. "Did you not know
    that I must be in my Father's house?"</p>

    <p>They did not understand these words; but Mary thought often
    about them afterward; for she felt her son was no common child,
    and that his words had a deep meaning. Though Jesus was wise
    beyond his years, he obeyed Joseph and his mother in all
    things. He went with them to Nazareth, and lived contented with
    the plain life of their country home.</p>

    <p>As the years went on, Jesus grew from a boy to a young man.
    He grew, too, in knowledge, and in wisdom, and in the favor of
    God. He won the love of all who knew him, for there was
    something in his nature that drew all hearts, both young and
    old.</p>

    <p>Jesus learned the trade of a carpenter
    with<a name="Page_192"
       id="Page_192"></a> Joseph; and when Joseph died, while Jesus
       was still a young man, Jesus worked as a carpenter, and
       helped his mother take care of the family. And so in the
       carpenter shop, and the quiet life of a country village, and
       the worship of the synagogue, the years passed until Jesus
       was thirty years of age.<a name="Page_193"

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_WATER_THAT_WAS_TURNED_INTO_WINE"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_WATER_THAT_WAS_TURNED_INTO_WINE"></a>THE
       STORY OF THE WATER THAT WAS TURNED INTO WINE</h2>

    <p>A few days after Jesus met his followers or disciples at the
    river Jordan, he came with these men to a town in Galilee
    called Cana, to be present at a wedding. In those lands a feast
    was always held at a wedding, and often the friends of those
    who were married stayed several days, eating and drinking
    together.</p>

    <p>The mother of Jesus was at this wedding as a friend of the
    family; for Nazareth, where she lived, was quite near to Cana.
    Before the wedding feast was over, all the wine had been used,
    and there was no more for the guests to drink. The mother of
    Jesus knew that her son had power to do whatever he chose; and
    she said to him; "They have no wine."</p>

    <p>Jesus said to her: "O woman, what have I to do with thee? My
    hour is not yet come."</p>

    <p>But his mother knew that Jesus would in some way help the
    people in their need, and she said to the servants who were
    waiting at the table:</p>

    <p>"Whatever he tells you to do, be sure to do it."</p>

    <p>In the dining hall were standing six large stone jars, each
    about as large as a barrel, holding twenty-five gallons. These
    jars held water <a name="Page_194"
       id="Page_194"></a>for washing, as the Jews washed their
       hands before every meal, and washed their feet as often as
       they came from walking in the street, since they wore no
       shoes, but only sandals. Jesus said to the servants:</p>

    <p>"Fill the jars with water."</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="FILL_THE_JARS_WITH_WATER"
             id="FILL_THE_JARS_WITH_WATER"><img src="./images/figure52.png"
             title="Fill the jars with water"
             alt="Fill the jars with water" /></a><br />
        <i>"Fill the jars with water"</i>
    </div>

    <p>The servants obeyed Jesus, and filled the jars up to the
    brim. Then Jesus spoke to them again, and said:</p>

    <p>"Now draw out some of the water, and take it to the ruler of
    the feast."</p>

    <p>They drew out water from the jars, and saw that it had been
    turned into wine. The ruler did not know from what place the
    wine had come; <a name="Page_195"
       id="Page_195"></a>but he said to the young man who had just
       been married, the bridegroom:</p>

    <p>"At a feast everybody gives his best wine at the beginning,
    and afterward, when his guests have drunk freely, he brings on
    wine that is not so good; but you have kept the good wine until
    now."</p>

    <p>This was the first time that Jesus used the power that God
    had given him, to do what no other man could do. Such works as
    these were called "miracles"; and Jesus did them as signs of
    his power as the Son of God. When the disciples saw this
    miracle, they believed in Jesus more fully than before.</p>

    <p>After this Jesus went with his mother and his younger
    brothers to a place called Capernaum, on the shore of the Sea
    of Galilee. But they stayed there only a few days, for the
    feast of the Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
    to attend it. You remember that the feast of the Passover was
    held every year, to keep in mind how God had led the people of
    Israel out of Egypt long before.</p>

    <p>When Jesus came to Jerusalem, he found in the courts of the
    Temple men who were selling oxen and sheep and doves for the
    sacrifices, and other men sitting at tables changing the money
    of Jews who came from other lands into the money of Judea. All
    this made the courts <a name="Page_196"
       id="Page_196"></a>around the Temple seem like a market, and
       not a place for the worship of God.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="TAKE_THESE_THINGS_AWAY"
             id="TAKE_THESE_THINGS_AWAY"><img src="./images/figure53_th.jpg"
             title="Take these things away"
             alt="Take these things away" /></a><br />
        <i>"Take these things away"</i>
    </div>

    <p>Jesus picked up some cord and made from it a little whip.
    With it he began to drive out of the Temple all the buyers and
    sellers. He was but one, and they were many; but such power was
    in his look, that they ran before him. He <a name="Page_197"
       id="Page_197"></a>drove the men and the sheep and the oxen;
       he overturned the tables and threw on the floor the money,
       and to those who were selling the doves he said: "Take these
       things away; make not my Father's house a house for selling
       and buying!"</p>

    <p>The acts of Jesus were not pleasing to the rulers of the
    Jews, for many of them were making money by this selling of
    sacrifices and changing of money. Some of the rulers came to
    Jesus and said to him: "What right have you to come here and do
    such things as these? What sign can you show that God has given
    to you power to rule in this place?"</p>

    <p>Jesus said to them: "I will give you a sign. Destroy this
    house of God, and in three days I will raise it up."</p>

    <p>Then said the Jews, "It has taken forty-six years to build
    this Temple, and it is not finished yet. Will you raise it up
    in three days?"</p>

    <p>But Jesus did not mean that Temple on Mount Moriah. He was
    speaking of himself, for in him God was dwelling as in a
    temple, and he meant that when they should put him to death, he
    would rise again in three days. Afterward, when Jesus had died
    and risen again, his followers, the disciples, thought of what
    he had said, and understood these words.</p>

       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_STRANGER_AT_THE_WELL"></a>THE STORY OF
       THE STRANGER AT THE WELL</h2>

    <p>While Jesus was teaching in Jerusalem and in the country
    places near it, John the Baptist was still preaching and
    baptizing. But already the people were leaving John and going
    to hear Jesus. Some of the followers of John the Baptist were
    not pleased as they saw that fewer people came to their master,
    and that the crowds were seeking Jesus. But John said to them:
    "I told you that I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before
    him. Jesus is the Christ, the king. He must grow greater, while
    I must grow less; and I am glad that it is so."</p>

    <p>Soon after this, Herod Antipas, the king of the province or
    land of Galilee, put John in prison. Herod had taken for his
    wife a woman named Herodias, who had left her husband to live
    with Herod, which was very wicked. John sent word to Herod,
    that it was not right for him to have this woman as his wife.
    These words of John made Herodias very angry. She hated John,
    and tried to kill him. Herod himself did not hate John so
    greatly, for he knew that John had spoken the truth. But he was
    weak, and <a name="Page_199"
       id="Page_199"></a>yielded to his wife Herodias. To please
       her, he sent John the Baptist to a lonely prison among the
       mountains east of the Dead Sea; for the land in that region,
       as well as Galilee, was under Herod's rule. There in prison
       Herod hoped to keep John safe from the hate of his wife
       Herodias.</p>

    <p>Soon after John the Baptist was thrown into prison, Jesus
    left the country near Jerusalem with his disciples, and went
    toward Galilee, the province in the north. Between Judea in the
    south and Galilee in the north, lay the land of Samaria, where
    the Samaritans lived, who hated the Jews. They worshipped the
    Lord as the Jews worshipped him, but they had their own Temple
    and their own priests. And they had their own Bible, which was
    only the five books of Moses; for they would not read the other
    books of the old Testament. The Jews and the Samaritans would
    scarcely ever speak to each other, so great was the hate
    between them.</p>

    <p>When Jews went from Galilee to Jerusalem, or from Jerusalem
    to Galilee, they would not pass through Samaria, but went down
    the mountains to the river Jordan, and walked beside the river,
    in order to go around Samaria. But Jesus, when he would go from
    Jerusalem to Galilee, walked over the mountains straight
    through Samaria. One morning while he was on his journey,
    <a name="Page_200"
       id="Page_200"></a>he stopped to rest beside an old well at
       the foot of Mount Gerizim, not far from the city of Shechem,
       but nearer to a little village that was called Sychar. This
       well had been dug by Jacob, the great father or ancestor of
       the Israelites, many hundreds of years before. It was an old
       well then in the days of Jesus; and it is much older now;
       for the same well may be seen in that place still. Even now
       travelers may have a drink from Jacob's well.</p>

    <p>It was early in the morning, about sunrise, when Jesus was
    sitting by Jacob's well. He was very tired, for he had walked a
    long journey; he was hungry, and his disciples had gone to the
    village near at hand to buy food. He was thirsty, too; and as
    he looked into the well he could see the water a hundred feet
    below, but he had no rope with which to let down a cup or a jar
    to draw up some water to drink.</p>

    <p>Just at this moment a Samaritan woman came to the well, with
    her water-jar upon her head, and her rope in her hand. Jesus
    looked at her, and in one glance read her soul, and saw all her
    life.</p>

    <p>He knew that Jews did not often speak to Samaritans, but he
    said to her:</p>

    <p>"Please to give me a drink?"</p>

    <p>The woman saw from his looks and his dress that he was a
    Jew, and she said to him:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_201"
       id="Page_201"></a>How is it that you, who are a Jew, ask
       drink of me, a Samaritan woman?"</p>

    <p>Jesus answered her:</p>

    <p>"If you knew what God's free gift is, and if you knew who it
    is that says to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would ask him to
    give you living water, and he would give it to you."</p>

    <p>There was something in the words and the looks of Jesus
    which made the woman feel that he was not a common man. She
    said to him: "Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the
    well is deep. Where can you get that living water? Are you
    greater than our father Jacob, who drank from this well, and
    who gave it to us?"</p>

    <p>"Whoever drinks of this water," said Jesus, "shall thirst
    again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him,
    shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall
    be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting
    life."</p>

    <p>"Sir," said the woman, "give me some of this water of yours,
    so that I will not thirst any more, nor come all the way to
    this well."</p>

    <p>Jesus looked at the woman, and said to her, "Go home, and
    bring your husband, and come here."</p>

    <p>"I have no husband," answered the woman.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Jesus, "you have spoken the
    truth.<a name="Page_202"
       id="Page_202"></a> You have no husband. But you have had
       five husbands, and the man whom you now have is not your
       husband."</p>

    <p>The woman was filled with wonder as she heard this. She saw
    that here was a man who knew what others could not know. She
    felt that God had spoken to him, and she said:</p>

    <p>"Sir, I see that you are a prophet of God. Tell me whether
    our people or the Jews are right. Our fathers have worshipped
    on this mountain. The Jews say that Jerusalem is the place
    where men should go to worship. Now, which of these is the
    right place?"</p>

    <p>"Woman, believe me," said Jesus, "there is coming a time
    when men shall worship God in other places besides on this
    mountain and in Jerusalem. The time is near; it has even now
    come, when the true worshippers everywhere shall pray to God in
    spirit and in truth; for God himself is a Spirit."</p>

    <p>The woman said: "I know that the Anointed one is coming, the
    Christ. When he comes, he will teach us all things."</p>

    <p>Jesus said to her:</p>

    <p>"I that speak to you now am he, the Christ!"</p>

    <p>Just at this time the disciples of Jesus came back from the
    village. They wondered to see Jesus talking with this Samaritan
    woman, but they said nothing.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_203"
       id="Page_203"></a>The woman had come to draw water, but in
       her interest in this wonderful stranger, she forgot her
       errand. Leaving her water-jar, she ran back to her village,
       and said to the people:</p>

    <p>"Come, see a man who told me everything that I have done in
    all my life! Is not this man the Christ whom we are looking
    for?"</p>

    <p>Soon the woman came back to the well with many of her
    people. They asked Jesus to come to their town, and to stay
    there and teach them. He went with them, and stayed there two
    days, teaching the people, who were Samaritans. And many of the
    people in that place believed in Jesus, and said:</p>

    <p>"We have heard for ourselves; now we know that this is
    indeed the Saviour of the world."<a name="Page_204"

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_FISHERMEN"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_FISHERMEN"></a>THE STORY OF THE
       FISHERMEN</h2>

    <p>When Jesus began to teach the people by the river Jordan, a
    few young men came to him as followers, or disciples. Some of
    these men were Andrew and John, Peter and Philip and Nathanael.
    While Jesus was teaching near Jerusalem and in Samaria, these
    men stayed with Jesus; but when he came to Galilee, they went
    to their homes and work, for most of them were fishermen from
    the Sea of Galilee.</p>

    <p>One morning, soon after Jesus came to Capernaum, he went out
    of the city, by the sea, followed by a great throng of people,
    who had come together to see him and to hear him. On the shore
    were lying two fishing boats, one of which belonged to Simon
    and Andrew, the other to James and John and their father
    Zebedee. The men themselves were not in the boats, but were
    washing their nets near by.</p>

    <p>Jesus stepped into the boat that belonged to Simon Peter and
    his brother Andrew, and asked them to push it out a little into
    the lake, so that he could talk to the people from it without
    being crowded too closely. They pushed it out, and then Jesus
    sat in the boat, and spoke to the people, as they stood upon
    the beach. After he had <a name="Page_205"
       id="Page_205"></a>finished speaking to the people, and had
       sent them away, he said to Simon Peter:</p>

    <p>"Put out into the deep water and let down your nets to catch
    some fish."</p>

        </a><br />
        <i>The net caught so many fishes they could not pull it
        up</i>
    </div>

    <p>"Master," said Simon, "we have been fishing all night, and
    have caught nothing; but if it is your will, I will let down
    the net again."</p>

    <p>They did as Jesus bade them; and now the net caught so many
    fishes that Simon and Andrew could not pull it up, and it was
    in danger of breaking. They made signs to the two brothers,
    James and John, who were in the other boat, for them to come
    and help them. They came, and lifted the net, and poured out
    the fish. There <a name="Page_206"
       id="Page_206"></a>were so many of them that both the boats
       were filled, and began to sink.</p>

    <p>When Simon Peter saw this, he was struck with wonder, and
    felt that it was by the power of God. He fell down at the feet
    of Jesus, saying: "Oh Lord, I am full of sin, and am not worthy
    of all this! Leave me, O Lord."</p>

    <p>But Jesus said to Simon, and to the others, "Fear not; but
    follow me, and I will make you from this time fishers of
    men."</p>

    <p>From that time these four men, Simon and Andrew, James and
    John, gave up their nets and their work, and became disciples
    of Jesus.</p>

    <p>On the Sabbath, after this, Jesus and his disciples went
    together to the synagogue, and spoke to the people. They
    listened to him and were surprised at his teaching; for while
    the scribes always repeated what other scribes had said before,
    Jesus never spoke of what the men of old time had taught, but
    spoke in his own name, and by his own power, saying, "I say
    unto you," as one who had the right to speak. Men felt that
    Jesus was speaking to them as the voice of God.</p>

    <p>On one Sabbath, while Jesus was preaching, a man came into
    the synagogue who had in him an evil spirit; for sometimes evil
    spirits came into men, and lived in them and spoke out from
    them. The evil spirit in this man cried out, saying:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_207"
       id="Page_207"></a>Let us alone, thou Jesus of Nazareth! What
       have we to do with thee? Hast thou come to destroy us? I
       know thee; and I know who thou art, the Holy one of
       God!"</p>

    <p>Then Jesus spoke to the evil spirit in the man:</p>

    <p>"Be still; and come out of this man!"</p>

    <p>Then the evil spirit threw the man down, and seemed as if he
    would tear him apart; but he left the man lying on the ground,
    without harm.</p>

    <p>Then wonder fell upon all the people. They were filled with
    fear, and said: "What mighty word is this? This man speaks even
    to the evil spirits, and they obey him!"</p>

    <p>After the meeting in the synagogue, Jesus went into the
    house where Simon Peter lived. There he saw lying upon a bed
    the mother of Simon's wife, who was very ill with a burning
    fever. He stood over her, and touched her hand. At once the
    fever left her; she rose up from her bed and waited upon
    them.</p>

    <p>At sunset, the Sabbath day was over; and then they brought
    to Jesus from all parts of the city those that were sick, and
    some that had evil spirits in them. Jesus laid his hands upon
    the sick, and they became well; he drove out the evil spirits
    by a word, and would not allow them to speak.<a name="Page_208"

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_SERMON_ON_THE_MOUNT"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_SERMON_ON_THE_MOUNT"></a>THE STORY OF
       THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT</h2>

    <p>Among the Jews there was one class of men hated and despised
    by the people more than any other. That was "the publicans."
    These were the men who took from the people the tax which the
    Roman rulers had laid upon the land. Many of these publicans
    were selfish, grasping, and cruel. They robbed the people,
    taking more than was right. Some of them were honest men,
    dealing fairly, and taking no more for the tax than was
    needful; but because so many were wicked, all the publicans
    were hated alike; and they were called "sinners" by the
    people.</p>

    <p>One day, when Jesus was going out of Capernaum, to the
    seaside, followed by a great crowd of people, he passed a
    publican, or tax-gatherer, who was seated at his table taking
    money from the people who came to pay their taxes. This man was
    named Matthew, or Levi; for many Jews had two names. Jesus
    could look into the hearts of men, and he saw that Matthew was
    one who might help him as one of his disciples. He looked upon
    Matthew, and said:</p>

    <p>"Follow me!"</p>

    <p><a name="Page_209"
       id="Page_209"></a>At once, the publican rose up from his
       table, and left it to go with Jesus. All the people
       wondered, as they saw one of the hated publicans among the
       disciples, with Peter, and John, and the rest. But Jesus
       believed that there is good in all kinds of people. Most of
       the men who followed him were poor fishermen. None of them,
       so far as we know, was rich. And when he called Matthew he
       saw a man with a true and loving heart, whose rising up to
       follow Jesus just as soon as he was called showed what a
       brave and faithful friend he would be. The first of the four
       books about Jesus bears Matthew's name.</p>

    <p>A little while after Jesus called him, Matthew made a great
    feast for Jesus at his house; and to the feast he invited many
    publicans, and others whom the Jews called sinners. The
    Pharisees saw Jesus sitting among these people, and they said
    with scorn to his disciples:</p>

    <p>"Why does your Master sit at the table with publicans and
    sinners?"</p>

    <p>Jesus heard of what these men had said, and he said:</p>

    <p>"Those that are well do not need a doctor to cure them, but
    those that are sick do need one. I go to these people because
    they know that they are sinners and need to be saved. I came
    not to call those who think themselves to be good, but those
    who wish to be made better."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_210"
       id="Page_210"></a>One evening Jesus went alone to a mountain
       not far from Capernaum. A crowd of people and his disciples
       followed him; but Jesus left them all, and went up to the
       top of the mountain, where he could be alone. There he
       stayed all night, praying to God, his Father and our Father.
       In the morning, out of all his followers, he chose twelve
       men who should walk with him and listen to his words, so
       that they might be able to teach others in turn. Some of
       these men he had called before; but now he called them
       again, and others with them. They were called "The Twelve,"
       or "the disciples"; and after Jesus went to heaven, they
       were called "The Apostles," a word which means "those who
       were sent out," because Jesus sent them out to preach the
       gospel to the world.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_211"
       id="Page_211"></a>The names of the twelve disciples, or
       apostles, were these: Simon Peter and his brother Andrew;
       James and John, the two sons of Zebedee; Philip of
       Bethsaida, and Nathanael, who was also called Bartholomew, a
       name which means "the son of Tholmai"; Thomas, who was also
       called Didymus, a name which means "a twin," and Matthew the
       publican, or tax-gatherer; another James, the son of
       Alpheus, who was called "James the Less," to keep his name
       apart from the first James, the brother of John; and
       Lebbeus, who was also called Thaddeus. Lebbeus was also
       called Judas, but he was a different man from another Judas,
       whose name is always given last. The eleventh name was
       another Simon, who was called "the Cananean" or "Simon
       Zelotes"; and the last name was Judas Iscariot, who was
       afterward the traitor. We know very little about most of
       these men, but some of them in later days did a great work.
       Simon Peter was a leader among them, but most of them were
       common sort of men of whom the best we know is that they
       loved Jesus and followed him to the end. Some died for him,
       and some served him in distant and dangerous places.</p>

        <i>Then, on the mountain, he preached</i>
    </div>

    <p>Before all the people who had come to hear him, Jesus called
    these twelve men to stand by his side. Then, on the mountain,
    he preached to these disciples and to the great company of
    <a name="Page_212"
       id="Page_212"></a>people. The disciples stood beside him,
       and the great crowd of people stood in front, while Jesus
       spoke. What he said on that day is called "The Sermon on the
       Mount." Matthew wrote it down, and you can read it in his
       gospel, in the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters. Jesus
       began with these words to his disciples:</p>

    <p>"Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom
    of heaven.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_213"
       id="Page_213"></a>Blessed are they that mourn: for they
       shall be comforted.</p>

    <p>"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</p>

    <p>"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
    righteousness: for they shall be filled.</p>

    <p>"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</p>

    <p>"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</p>

    <p>"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the
    children of God.</p>

    <p>"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness'
    sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

    <p>"Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute
    you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for
    my sake.</p>

    <p>"Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad: for great is your reward
    in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were
    before you.</p>

    <p>"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
    savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for
    nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of
    men.</p>

    <p>"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an
    hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it
    under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto
    all that <a name="Page_214"
       id="Page_214"></a>are in the house. Let your light so shine
       before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify
       your Father which is in heaven."</p>

    <p>It was in this Sermon on the Mount that Jesus told the
    people how they should pray, and he gave them the prayer which
    we all know as the Lord's Prayer.</p>

    <p>And this was the end of the Sermon:</p>

    <p>"Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and
    doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his
    house upon a rock:</p>

    <p>"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
    blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not; for it was
    founded upon a rock.</p>

    <p>"And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
    them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his
    house upon the sand:</p>

    <p>"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
    blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the
    fall of it."<a name="Page_215"

       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_MIRACLE_WORKER"></a>THE STORY OF THE
       MIRACLE WORKER</h2>

    <p>There was at Capernaum an officer of the Roman army, a man
    who had under him a company of a hundred men. They called him
    "a centurion," a word which means "commanding a hundred"; but
    we should call him "a captain." This man was not a Jew, but was
    what the Jews called "a Gentile," "a foreigner"; a name which
    the Jews gave to all people outside their own race. All the
    world except the Jews themselves were Gentiles.</p>

    <p>This Roman centurion was a good man, and he loved the Jews,
    because through them he had heard of God, and had learned how
    to worship God. Out of his love for the Jews, he had built for
    them with his own money a synagogue, which may have been the
    very synagogue in which Jesus taught on the Sabbath days.</p>

    <p>The centurion had a young servant, a boy whom he loved
    greatly; and this boy was very sick with a palsy, and near to
    death. The centurion had heard that Jesus could cure those who
    were sick; and he asked the chief men of the synagogue, who
    were called its "elders," to go to Jesus and ask him to come
    and cure his young servant.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="SPEAK_THE_WORD_AND_MY_SERVANT_SHALL_BE_CURED"

             </a><br />
        <i>"Speak the word and my servant shall be cured"</i>
    </div>

    <p>The elders spoke to Jesus, just as he came again to
    Capernaum, after the Sermon on the Mount. They asked Jesus to
    go with them to the centurion's house; and they said:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_217"
       id="Page_217"></a>He is a worthy man, and it is fitting that
       you should help him, for, though a Gentile, he loves our
       people, and he has built for us our synagogue."</p>

    <p>Then Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."</p>

    <p>But while he was on his way&mdash;and with him were the
    elders, and his disciples, and a great crowd of people, who
    hoped to see the work of healing&mdash;the centurion sent some
    other friends to Jesus with this message:</p>

    <p>"Lord, do not take the trouble to come to my house; for I am
    not worthy that one so high as you are should come under my
    roof; and I did not think that I was worthy to go and speak to
    you. But speak only a word where you are, and my servant shall
    be made well. For I also am a man under rule, and I have
    soldiers under me; and I say to one 'Go,' and he goes; and to
    another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,'
    and he does it. You, too, have power to speak and to be obeyed.
    Speak the word, and my servant shall be cured."</p>

    <p>When Jesus heard this, he wondered at this man's faith. He
    turned to the people following him, and said:</p>

    <p>"In truth I say to you, I have not found such faith as this
    in all Israel!"</p>

    <p>Then he spoke to the friends of the centurion who had
    brought the word from him:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_218"
       id="Page_218"></a>Go and say to this man, 'As you have
       believed in me, so shall it be done to you.'"</p>

    <p>Then those who had been sent, went again to the centurion's
    house, and found that in that very hour his servant had been
    made perfectly well.</p>

    <p>On the day after this, Jesus with his disciples and many
    people went out from Capernaum, and turned southward, and came
    to a village called Nain. Just as Jesus and his disciples came
    near to the gate of the city, they were met by a company who
    were carrying out a dead man to be buried. He was a young man,
    and the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.</p>

    <p>When the Lord Jesus saw the mother in her grief, he pitied
    her, and said, "Do not weep."</p>

    <p>He drew near, and touched the frame on which they were
    carrying the body, wrapped round and round with long strips of
    linen. The bearers looked with wonder on this stranger, and set
    down the frame with its body, and stood still. Standing beside
    the body, Jesus said:</p>

    <p>"Young man, I say to you, Rise up!"</p>

    <p>And in a moment the young man sat up and began to speak.
    Jesus gave him to his mother, who now saw that her son who had
    been dead, was alive again.</p>

    <p>And Jesus went through all that part of Galilee, working
    miracles and preaching and teaching <a name="Page_219"
       id="Page_219"></a>in all the villages, telling the people
       everywhere the good news of the kingdom of God.</p>

    <p>The children loved to gather around him, and when his
    disciples would have driven them away he said, "Suffer the
    little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of
    such is the kingdom of heaven."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_220"
       id="Page_220"></a>One Sabbath day, as Jesus and his
       disciples were walking in Jerusalem, they met a blind man
       begging. This man in all his life had never seen; for he had
       been born blind. The disciples said to Jesus as they were
       passing him: "Master, whose fault was it that this man was
       born blind? Was it because he has sinned, or did his parents
       sin?"</p>

    <p>For the Jews thought that when any evil came, it was caused
    by some one's sin. But Jesus said:</p>

    <p>"This man was born blind, not because of his parents' sin,
    nor because of his own, but so that God might show his power in
    him. We must do God's work while it is day, for the night is
    coming when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am
    the light of the world."</p>

    <p>When Jesus had said this, he spat on the ground, and mixed
    up the spittle with earth, making a little lump of clay. This
    clay Jesus spread on the eyes of the blind man; and then he
    said to him: "Go wash in the pool of Siloam."</p>

    <p>The pool of Siloam was a large cistern, or, reservoir, on
    the southeast of Jerusalem, outside the wall, where the valley
    of Gihon and the valley of Kedron come together. To go to this
    pool, the blind man, with two great blotches of mud on his
    face, must walk through the streets of the city, out of the
    gate, and into the valley. He went, and felt his way down the
    steps into the <a name="Page_221"
       id="Page_221"></a>pool of Siloam. There he washed, and then
       at once his life-long blindness passed away, and he could
       see.</p>

    <p>When the man came back to the part of the city where he
    lived, his neighbors could scarcely believe that he was the
    same man. They said: "Is not this the man who used to sit on
    the street begging?"</p>

    <p>"This must be the same man," said some; but others said:
    "No, it is some one who looks like him."</p>

    <p>But the man said, "I am the very same man who was
    blind!"</p>

    <p>"Why, how did this come to pass?" they asked. "How were your
    eyes opened?"</p>

    <p>"The man, named Jesus," he answered, "mixed clay, and put it
    on my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam and
    wash,' and I went and washed, and then I could see."</p>

    <p>"Where is this man?" they asked him.</p>

    <p>"I do not know," said the man.</p>

    <p>Some of the Pharisees, the men who made a show of always
    obeying the law, asked the man how he had been made to see. He
    said to them, as he had said before:</p>

    <p>"A man put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and my sight came
    to me."</p>

    <p>Some of the Pharisees said:</p>

    <p>"The man who did this is not a man of God,
    <a name="Page_222"
       id="Page_222"></a>because he does not keep the Sabbath. He
       makes clay, and puts it on men's eyes, working on the
       Sabbath day. He is a sinner!"</p>

    <p>Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such
    wonderful works?"</p>

    <p>And thus the people were divided in what they thought of
    Jesus. They asked the man who had been blind: "What do you
    think of this man who has opened your eyes?"</p>

    <p>"He is a prophet of God," said the man.</p>

    <p>But the leading Jews would not believe that this man had
    gained his sight, until they had sent for his father and his
    mother. The Jews asked them:</p>

    <p>"Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How is it
    that he can now see?"</p>

    <p>His parents were afraid to tell all they knew; for the Jews
    had agreed that if any man should say Jesus was the Christ, the
    Saviour, he should be turned out of the synagogue, and not be
    allowed to worship any more with the people. So his parents
    said to the Jews:</p>

    <p>"We know that this is our son, and we know that he was born
    blind. But how he was made to see, we do not know; or who has
    opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age; ask him, and let
    him speak for himself."</p>

    <p>Then again the rulers of the Jews called the man who had
    been blind; and they said to him:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_223"
       id="Page_223"></a>Give God the praise for your sight. We
       know that this man who made clay on the Sabbath day is a
       sinner."</p>

    <p>"Whether that man is a sinner, or not, I do not know,"
    answered the man; "but one thing I do know, that once I was
    blind, and now I see. We know that God does not hear sinners;
    but God hears only those who worship him, and do his will.
    Never before has any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.
    If this man were not from God, he could not do such works as
    these!"</p>

    <p>The rulers of the Jews, these Pharisees, then said to the
    man: "You were born in sin, and do you try to teach us?"</p>

    <p>And they turned him out of the synagogue, and would not let
    any one worship with him. Jesus heard of this; and when Jesus
    found him, he said to him:</p>

    <p>"Do you believe on the Son of God?"</p>

    <p>The man said:</p>

    <p>"And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?"</p>

    <p>"You have seen him," said Jesus, "and it is he who now talks
    with you!"</p>

    <p>The man said, "Lord, I believe."</p>

    <p>And he fell down before Jesus, and worshipped
    him.<a name="Page_224"

    <h2><a name="THE_GOOD_SHEPHERD_AND_THE_GOOD_SAMARITAN"
       id="THE_GOOD_SHEPHERD_AND_THE_GOOD_SAMARITAN"></a>THE GOOD
       SHEPHERD AND THE GOOD SAMARITAN</h2>

    <p>Soon afterward Jesus gave to the people in Jerusalem the
    parable or story of "The Good Shepherd."</p>

    <p>"Verily, verily (that is, 'in truth, in truth'), I say to
    you, if any one does not go into the sheepfold by the door, but
    climbs up some other way, it is a sign that he is a thief and a
    robber. But the one who comes in by the door is a shepherd of
    the sheep. The porter opens the door to him, and the sheep know
    him, and listen to his call, for he calls his own sheep by name
    and leads them out to the pasture-field. And when he has led
    out his sheep, he goes in front of them, and the sheep follow
    him, for they know his voice. The sheep will not follow a
    stranger, for they do not know the stranger's voice."</p>

    <p>The people did not understand what all this meant, and as
    Jesus explained it to them, he said: "Verily, verily, I say
    unto you, I am the door that leads to the sheepfold. If any man
    comes to the sheep in any other way than through me and in my
    name, he is a thief and a robber; but those who are the true
    sheep will not hear such. I am the door; if any man goes
    <a name="Page_225"
       id="Page_225"></a>into the fold through me, he shall be
       saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find
       pasture.</p>

    <p>"The thief comes to the fold that he may steal and rob the
    sheep, and kill them; but I came to the fold that they may have
    life, and may have all that they need. I am the good shepherd;
    the good shepherd will give up his own life to save his sheep;
    and I will give up my life that my sheep may be saved.</p>

    <p>"I am the good shepherd; and just as a true shepherd knows
    all the sheep in his fold, so I know my own, and my own know
    me, even as I know the Father, and the Father knows me; and I
    lay down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have, which
    are not of this fold; them also I must lead; and they shall
    hear my voice; and there shall be one flock and one
    shepherd."</p>

    <p>The Jews could not understand these words of Jesus; but they
    became very angry with him, because he spoke of God as his
    Father. They took up stones to throw them at him, and tried to
    seize him, intending to kill him. But Jesus escaped from their
    hands, and went away to the land beyond Jordan, at the place
    called "Bethabara," or "Bethany beyond Jordan," the same place
    where he had been baptized by John the Baptist more than two
    years before. From this place Jesus wished to go out through
    the land in the east of the Jordan, a land which is
    <a name="Page_226"
       id="Page_226"></a>called "Perea," a word that means
       "beyond." But before going out through this land, Jesus sent
       out seventy chosen men from among his followers to go to all
       the villages, and to make the people ready for his own
       coming afterward. He gave to these seventy the same commands
       that he had given to the twelve disciples when he sent them
       through Galilee, and sent them out in pairs, two men to
       travel and to preach together. He said:</p>

    <p>"I send you forth as lambs among wolves. Carry no purse, no
    bag for food, no shoes except those that you are wearing. Do
    not stop to talk with people by the way; but go through the
    towns and villages, healing the sick, and preaching to the
    people, 'The kingdom of God is coming,' He that hears you,
    hears me; and he that refuses you, refuses me; and he that will
    not hear me, will not hear him that sent me."</p>

    <p>And after a time the seventy men came again to Jesus,
    saying:</p>

    <p>"Lord, even the evil spirits obey our words in thy
    name!"</p>

    <p>And Jesus said to them:</p>

    <p>"I saw Satan, the king of the evil spirits, falling down
    like lightning from heaven. I have given you power to tread
    upon serpents and scorpions, and nothing shall harm you. Still,
    do not rejoice because the evil spirits obey you;
    <a name="Page_227"
       id="Page_227"></a>but rejoice that your names are written in
       heaven."</p>

    <p>And at that time, one of the scribes&mdash;men who wrote
    copies of the books of the Old Testament, and studied them, and
    taught them&mdash;came to Jesus and asked him a question, to
    see what answer he would give. He said: "Master, what shall I
    do to have everlasting life?"</p>

    <p>Jesus said to the scribe: "What is written in the law? You
    are a reader of God's law; tell me what it says."</p>

    <p>Then the man gave this answer:</p>

    <p>"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
    with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy
    mind; and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."</p>

    <p>Jesus said to the man: "You have answered right; do this,
    and you shall have everlasting life."</p>

    <p>But the man was not satisfied. He asked another question:
    "And who is my neighbor?"</p>

    <p>To answer this question, Jesus gave the parable or story of
    "The Good Samaritan." He said: "A certain man was going down
    the lonely road from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among
    robbers, who stripped him of all that he had and beat him; and
    then went away, leaving him almost dead. It happened that a
    certain priest was going down that road; and when he saw
    <a name="Page_228"
       id="Page_228"></a>the man lying there, he passed by on the
       other side. And a Levite, also, when he came to the place,
       and saw the man, he too went by on the other side. But a
       certain Samaritan, as he was going down, came where this man
       was; and as soon as he saw him, he felt a pity for him. He
       came to the man, and dressed his wounds, pouring oil and
       wine into them. Then he lifted him up, and set him on his
       own beast of burden, and walked beside him to an inn. There
       he took care of him all night; and the next morning he took
       out from his purse two shillings, and gave them to the
       keeper of the inn, and said: 'Take care of him; and if you
       need to spend more than this, do so; and when I come again I
       will pay it to you.'"</p>

    </div>

    <p>From Jericho, Jesus and his disciples went up the mountains,
    and came to Bethany, where his friends Martha and Mary lived,
    and where he had raised Lazarus to life. Many people in
    Jerusalem heard that Jesus was there, and they went out of the
    city to see him, for Bethany was only two miles from Jerusalem.
    Some came also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the
    dead; but the rulers of the Jews said to each other:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_231"
       id="Page_231"></a>We must not only kill Jesus, but Lazarus,
       also; because on his account so many of the people are going
       after Jesus and are believing on him."</p>

    <p>The friends of Jesus in Bethany made a supper for Jesus, at
    the house of a man named Simon. He was called "Simon the
    leper"; and perhaps he was one whom Jesus had cured of leprosy.
    Jesus and his disciples, with Lazarus, leaned upon the couches
    around the table, as the guests; and Martha was one of those
    who waited upon them. While they were at the supper, Mary, the
    sister of Lazarus, came into the room, carrying a sealed jar of
    very precious perfume. She opened the jar, and poured some of
    the perfume upon the head of Jesus, and some upon his feet; and
    she wiped his feet with her long hair. And the whole house was
    filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</p>

    <p>But one of the disciples of Jesus, Judas Iscariot, was not
    pleased at this. He said: "Why was such a waste of the perfume
    made? This might have been sold for more than forty-five
    dollars, and the money given to the poor!"</p>

    <p>This he said, but not because he cared for the poor. Judas
    was the one who kept the bag of money for Jesus and the twelve;
    and he was a thief, and took away for his own use all the money
    that he could steal. But Jesus said:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_232"
       id="Page_232"></a>Let her alone; why do you find fault with
       the woman? She has done a good work upon me. You have the
       poor always with you, and whenever you wish, you can give to
       them. But you will have me with you only a little while. She
       has done what she could; for she has come to perfume my body
       for its burial. And truly I say to you, that wherever the
       gospel shall be preached throughout all the world, what this
       woman has done shall be told in memory of her."</p>

        <i>She wiped his feet with her hair</i>
    </div>

    <p>Perhaps Mary knew what others did not believe, that Jesus
    was soon to die; and she showed <a name="Page_233"
       id="Page_233"></a>her love for him, and her sorrow for his
       coming death, by this rich gift. But Judas, the disciple who
       carried the bag, was very angry at Jesus; and from that time
       he was looking for a chance to betray Jesus, or to give him
       up to his enemies. He went to the chief priests, and said:
       "What will you give me, if I will put Jesus in your
       hands?"</p>

    <p>They said, "We will give you thirty pieces of silver."</p>

    <p>And for thirty pieces of silver Judas promised to help them
    take Jesus, and make him their prisoner.</p>

    <p>On the morning after the supper at Bethany, Jesus called two
    of his disciples, and said to them:</p>

    <p>"Go into the next village, and at a place where two roads
    cross; and there you will find an ass tied, and a colt with it.
    Loose them, and bring them to me. And if any one says to you,
    'Why do you do this?' say, 'The Lord has need of them,' and
    they will let them go."</p>

    <p>They went to the place and found the ass and the colt, and
    were loosing them, when the owner said:</p>

    <p>"What are you doing, untying the ass?"</p>

    <p>And they said, as Jesus had told them to say:</p>

    <p>"The Lord has need of it."</p>

    <p>Then the owner gave them the ass and the colt
    <a name="Page_234"
       id="Page_234"></a>for the use of Jesus. They brought them to
       Jesus on the Mount of Olives; and they laid some of their
       own clothes on the colt for a cushion, and set Jesus upon
       it. Then all the disciples and a very great multitude threw
       their garments upon the ground for Jesus to ride upon.
       Others cut down branches from the trees and laid them on the
       ground. And as Jesus rode over the mountain toward
       Jerusalem, many walked before him waving branches of palm
       trees. And they all cried together:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="THEY_THREW_THEIR_GARMENTS_UPON_THE_GROUND_FOR_JESUS_TO_RIDE_UPON"

       that cometh in the name of the Lord! Blessed be the kingdom
       of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord!
       Hosanna in the highest!"</p>

    <p>These things they said, because they believed that Jesus was
    the Christ, the Anointed King; and they hoped that he would now
    set up his throne in Jerusalem. Some of the Pharisees in the
    crowd, who did not believe in Jesus, said to him:</p>

    <p>"Master, stop your disciples!"</p>

    <p>But Jesus said:</p>

    <p>"I tell you, that if these should be still, the very stones
    would cry out!"</p>

    <p>And when he came into Jerusalem with all this multitude, all
    the city was filled with wonder. They said: "Who is this?"</p>

    <p>And the multitude answered:</p>

    <p>"This is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth in Galilee!"</p>

    <p>And Jesus went into the Temple, and looked around it; but he
    did not stay, because the hour was late. He went again to
    Bethany, and there stayed at night with his friends.</p>

    <p>These things took place on Sunday, the first day of the
    week; and that Sunday in the year is called Palm Sunday,
    because of the palm branches which the people carried before
    Jesus.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_236"
       id="Page_236"></a>Many people heard him gladly, but the
       great city was deaf to his pleadings. "O Jerusalem,
       Jerusalem," he cried, "thou that killest the prophets, how
       often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a
       hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would
       not!"</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_BETRAYAL"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_BETRAYAL"></a>THE STORY OF THE
       BETRAYAL</h2>

    <p>At the foot of the Mount of Olives, near the path over the
    hill toward Bethany, there was an orchard of olive trees,
    called "The Garden of Gethsemane." The word "Gethsemane" means
    "oil press." Jesus often went to this place with his disciples,
    because of its quiet shade. At this garden he stopped, and
    outside he left eight of his disciples, saying to them, "Sit
    here while I go inside and pray."</p>

    <p>He took with him the three chosen ones, Peter, James, and
    John, and went within the orchard. Jesus knew that in a little
    while Judas would be there with a band of men to seize him;
    that in a few hours he would be beaten, and stripped, and led
    out to die. The thought of what he was to suffer came upon him
    and filled his soul with grief. He said to Peter and James and
    John:</p>

    <p>"My soul is filled with sorrow, a sorrow that almost kills
    me. Stay here and watch while I am praying."</p>

    <p>He went a little further among the trees, and flung himself
    down upon the ground, and cried out:</p>

    <p>"O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from
    me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou willest!"</p>

    <p><a name="Page_238"
       id="Page_238"></a>So earnest was his feeling and so great
       his suffering that there came out upon his face great drops
       of sweat like blood, falling upon the ground. After praying
       for a time, he rose up from the earth and went to his three
       disciples, and found them all asleep. He awaked them, and
       said to Peter: "What, could you not watch with me one hour?
       Watch and pray that you may not go into temptation. The
       spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</p>

    <p>He left them, and went a second time into the woods, and
    fell on his face, and prayed again, saying:</p>

    <p>"O my Father, if this cup cannot pass away, and I must drink
    it, then thy will be done."</p>

    <p>He came again to the three disciples, and found them
    sleeping; but this time he did not awake them. He went once
    more into the woods, and prayed, using the same words. And an
    angel from heaven came to him and gave him strength. He was now
    ready for the fate that was soon to come, and his heart was
    strong. Once more he went to the three disciples, and said to
    them: "You may as well sleep on now, and take your rest, for
    the hour is at hand; and already the Son of man is given by the
    traitor into the hands of sinners. But rise up and let us be
    going. See, the traitor is here!"</p>

    <p>The disciples awoke; they heard the noise of
    <a name="Page_239"
       id="Page_239"></a>a crowd, and saw the flashing of torches
       and the gleaming of swords and spears. In the throng they
       saw Judas standing, and they knew now that he was the
       traitor of whom Jesus had spoken the night before. Judas
       came rushing forward, and kissed Jesus, as though he were
       glad to see him. This was a signal that he had given
       beforehand to the band; for the men of the guard did not
       know Jesus, and Judas had said to them:</p>

    <p>"The one that I shall kiss is the man that you are to take;
    seize him and hold him fast."</p>

    <p>Jesus said to Judas, "Judas, do you betray the Son of man
    with a kiss?"</p>

    <p>Then he turned to the crowd, and said, "Whom do you
    seek?"</p>

    <p>They answered, "Jesus of Nazareth."</p>

    <p>Jesus said, "I am he."</p>

    <p>When Jesus said this, a sudden fear came upon his enemies;
    they drew back and fell upon the ground.</p>

    <p>After a moment, Jesus said again, "Whom do you seek?"</p>

    <p>And again they answered, "Jesus of Nazareth."</p>

    <p>And Jesus said, pointing to his disciples, "I told you that
    I am he. If you are seeking me, let these disciples go their
    own way."</p>

    </div>

    <p>But as they came forward to seize Jesus, Peter
    <a name="Page_240"
       id="Page_240"></a><a name="Page_241"
       id="Page_241"></a>drew his sword, and struck at one of the
       men in front, and cut off his right ear. The man was a
       servant of the high-priest, and his name was Malchus. Jesus
       said to Peter:</p>

    <p>"Put up the sword into its sheath; the cup which my Father
    has given me, shall I not drink it? Do you not know that I
    could call upon my Father, and he would send to me armies upon
    armies of angels?"</p>

    <p>Then he spoke to the crowd, "Let me do this." And he touched
    the place where the ear had been cut off, and it came on again
    and was well. Jesus said to the rulers and leaders of the armed
    men:</p>

    <p>"Do you come out against me with swords and clubs as though
    I were a robber? I was with you every day in the Temple, and
    you did not lift your hands against me. But the words in the
    scriptures must come to pass; and this is your hour."</p>

    <p>When the disciples of Jesus saw that he would not allow them
    to fight for him, they did not know what to do. In their sudden
    alarm they all ran away, and left their Master alone with his
    enemies. These men laid their hands on Jesus, and bound him,
    and led him away to the house of the high-priest. There were at
    that time two men called high-priests by the Jews. One was
    Annas, who had been high-priest until <a name="Page_242"
       id="Page_242"></a>his office had been taken from him by the
       Romans, and given to Caiphas, his son-in-law. But Annas
       still had great power among the people; and they brought
       Jesus, all bound as he was, first to Annas.</p>

    <p>Simon Peter, and John, the disciple whom Jesus loved, had
    followed after the crowd of those who carried Jesus away; and
    they came to the door of the high-priest's house. John knew the
    high-priest and went in; but Peter at first stayed outside,
    until John went out and brought him in. He came in, but did not
    dare to go into the room where Jesus stood before the
    high-priest Annas. In the court-yard of the house, they had
    made a fire of charcoal, and Peter stood among those who were
    warming themselves at the fire.</p>

    <p>Annas in the inner room asked Jesus about his disciples and
    his teaching. Jesus answered him:</p>

    <p>"What I have taught has been open in the synagogues and in
    the Temple. Why do you ask me? Ask those that heard me; they
    know what I said."</p>

    <p>Then one of the officers struck Jesus on the mouth, saying
    to him:</p>

    <p>"Is this the way that you answer the high-priest?"</p>

    <p>Jesus answered the officer calmly and quietly:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_243"
       id="Page_243"></a>If I have said anything evil, tell what
       the evil is; but if I have spoken the truth, why do you
       strike me?"</p>

    <p>While Annas and his men were thus showing their hate toward
    Jesus, who stood bound and alone among his enemies, Peter was
    still in the court-yard warming himself at the fire. A woman,
    who was a serving-maid in the house, looked at Peter sharply,
    and finally said to him:</p>

    <p>"You were one of those men with this Jesus of Nazareth!"</p>

    <p>Peter was afraid to tell the truth, and he answered her:</p>

    <p>"Woman, I do not know the man; and I do not know what you
    are talking about."</p>

    <p>And to get away from her, he went out into the porch of the
    house. There another woman-servant saw him and said: "This man
    was one of those with Jesus!"</p>

    <p>And Peter swore with an oath that he did not know Jesus at
    all. Soon a man came by, who was of kin to Malchus, whose ear
    Peter had cut off. He looked at Peter, and heard him speak, and
    said:</p>

    <p>"You are surely one of this man's disciples; for your speech
    shows that you came from Galilee."</p>

    <p>Then Peter began again to curse and to swear, declaring that
    he did not know the man.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_244"
       id="Page_244"></a>Just at that moment the loud, shrill
       crowing of a cock startled Peter; and at the same time he
       saw Jesus, who was being dragged through the hall from Annas
       to the council-room of Caiphas, the other high-priest. And
       the Lord turned as he was passing and looked at Peter.</p>

    <p>Then there flashed into Peter's mind what Jesus had said on
    the evening before!</p>

    <p>"Before the cock crows to-morrow morning, you will three
    times deny that you have ever known me."</p>

    <p>Then Peter went out of the high-priest's house into the
    street; and he wept bitterly because he had denied his
    Lord.<a name="Page_245"

       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_EMPTY_TOMB"></a>THE STORY OF THE EMPTY
       TOMB</h2>

    <p>After Jesus was taken before the high-priest where he was
    ridiculed and the people spat upon him, he was taken before the
    Roman Governor, Pontius Pilate, who ruled over Judea. He heard
    their complaints, but did not find any cause for putting him to
    death. But at last he yielded to their demands, although he
    declared Jesus was innocent of all wrong.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="HE_HEARD_THEIR_COMPLAINTS"
             id="HE_HEARD_THEIR_COMPLAINTS"><img src="./images/figure65_th.jpg"
             title="He heard their complaints"
             alt="He heard their complaints" /></a><br />
        <i>He heard their complaints</i>
    </div>

    <p>And so Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor,
    <a name="Page_246"
       id="Page_246"></a>gave command that Jesus should die by the
       cross. The Roman soldiers then took Jesus and beat him most
       cruelly; and then led him out of the city to the place of
       death. This was a place called "Golgotha" in the Jewish
       language, "Calvary" in that of the Romans; both words
       meaning "The Skull Place."</p>

    <p>With the soldiers, went out of the city a great crowd of
    people; some of them enemies of Jesus, glad to see him suffer;
    others of them friends of Jesus, and the women who had helped
    him, now weeping as they saw him, all covered with his blood
    and going out to die. But Jesus turned to them and said:</p>

    <p>"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for
    yourselves and for your children. For the days are coming when
    they shall count those happy who have no little ones to be
    slain; when they shall wish that the mountain might fall on
    them, and the hills might cover them, and hide them from their
    enemies!"</p>

    <p>They had tried to make Jesus bear his own cross, but soon
    found that he was too weak from his sufferings, and could not
    carry it. They seized on a man who was coming out of the
    country into the city, a man named Simon, and they made him
    carry the cross to its place at Calvary.</p>

    <p>It was the custom among the Jews to give to men about to die
    by the cross some medicine to <a name="Page_247"
       id="Page_247"></a>deaden their feelings, so that they would
       not suffer so greatly. They offered this to Jesus, but when
       he had tasted it and found what it was, he would not take
       it. He knew that he would die, but he wished to have his
       mind clear, and to understand what was done and what was
       said, even though his sufferings might be greater.</p>

    <p>At the place Calvary, they laid the cross down, and
    stretched Jesus upon it, and drove nails through his hands and
    feet to fasten him to the cross; and then they stood it upright
    with Jesus upon it. While the soldiers were doing this dreadful
    work, Jesus prayed for them to God, saying: "Father, forgive
    them; for they know not what they are doing."</p>

    <p>The soldiers also took the clothes that Jesus had worn,
    giving to each one a garment. But when they came to his
    undergarment, they found that it was woven and had no seams; so
    they said, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, to see
    who shall have it." So at the foot of the cross the soldiers
    threw lots for the garment of Christ.</p>

    <p>Two men who had been robbers and had been sentenced to die
    by the cross, were led out to die at the same time with Jesus.
    One was placed on a cross at his right side, and the other at
    his left; and to make Jesus appear as the worst, his cross
    stood in the middle. Over the head of<a name="Page_248"
       id="Page_248"></a> Jesus on his cross, they placed, by
       Pilate's order, a sign, on which was written:</p>

    <p class="center">"This is Jesus of Nazareth,<br />
    The King of the Jews."</p>

    <p>This was written in three languages; in Hebrew, which was
    the language of the Jews; in Latin, the language of the Romans,
    and in Greek. Many of the people read this writing; but the
    chief priests were not pleased with it. They urged Pilate to
    have it changed from "The King of the Jews" to "He said, I am
    King of the Jews." But Pilate would not change it. He said:</p>

    <p>"What I have written, I have written."</p>

    <p>And the people who passed by on the road, as they looked at
    Jesus on the cross, mocked at him. Some called out to him:</p>

    <p>"You that would destroy the Temple and build it in three
    days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, come down from
    the cross!"</p>

    <p>And the priests and scribes said:</p>

    <p>"He saved others, but he cannot save himself. Come down from
    the cross, and we will believe in you!"</p>

    <p>And one of the robbers, who was on his own cross beside that
    of Jesus, joined in the cry, and said: "If you are the Christ,
    save yourself and save us!"</p>

    <p><a name="Page_249"
       id="Page_249"></a>But the other robber said to him: "Have
       you no fear of God, to speak thus, while you are suffering
       the same fate with this man? And we deserve to die, but this
       man has done nothing wrong."</p>

    <p>Then this man said to Jesus: "Lord, remember me when thou
    comest into thy kingdom!"</p>

    <p>And Jesus answered him, as they were both hanging on their
    crosses: "To-day you shall be with me in heaven."</p>

    <p>Before the cross of Jesus his mother was standing, filled
    with sorrow for her son, and beside her was one of his
    disciples, John, the disciple whom he loved best. Other women
    besides his mother were there&mdash;his mother's sister, Mary
    the wife of Cleophas, and a woman named Mary Magdalene, out of
    whom a year before Jesus had sent an evil spirit. Jesus wished
    to give his mother, now that he was leaving her, into the care
    of John, and he said to her, as he looked from her to John:
    "Woman, see your son."</p>

    <p>And then to John he said: "Son, see your mother."</p>

    <p>And on that day John took the mother of Jesus home to his
    own house, and cared for her as his own mother.</p>

    <p>At about noon, a sudden darkness came over the land, and
    lasted for three hours. And in the <a name="Page_250"
       id="Page_250"></a>middle of the afternoon, when Jesus had
       been on the cross six hours of terrible pain, he cried out
       aloud words which meant:</p>

    <p>"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!" words which are
    the beginning of the twenty-second psalm, a psalm which long
    before had spoken of many of Christ's sufferings.</p>

    <p>After this he spoke again, saying, "I thirst!"</p>

    <p>And some one dipped a sponge in a cup of vinegar, and put it
    upon a reed, and gave him a drink of it. Then Jesus spoke his
    last words upon the cross:</p>

    <p>"It is finished! Father, into thy hands I give my
    spirit!"</p>

    <p>And then Jesus died. And at that moment, the veil in the
    Temple between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, was torn
    apart by unseen hands from the top to the bottom. And when the
    Roman officer, who had charge of the soldiers around the cross,
    saw what had taken place, and how Jesus died, he said: "Surely
    this was a righteous man; he was the Son of God."</p>

    <p>After Jesus was dead, one of the soldiers, to be sure that
    he was no longer living, ran his spear into the side of his
    dead body; and out of the wound came pouring both water and
    blood.</p>

    <p>There were even among the rulers of the Jews a few who were
    friends of Jesus, though they did not dare to follow Jesus
    openly. One of these <a name="Page_251"
       id="Page_251"></a>was Nicodemus, the ruler who came to see
       Jesus at night. Another was a rich man who came from the
       town of Arimathea, and was named Joseph. Joseph of Arimathea
       went boldly in to Pilate, and asked that the body of Jesus
       might be given to him. Pilate wondered that he had died so
       soon, for often men lived on the cross two or three days.
       But when he found that Jesus was really dead, he gave his
       body to Joseph.</p>

    <p>Then Joseph and his friends took down the body of Jesus from
    the cross, and wrapped it in fine linen. And Nicodemus brought
    some precious spices, myrrh and aloes, which they wrapped up
    with the body. Then they placed the body in Joseph's own new
    tomb, which was a cave dug out of the rock, in a garden near
    the place of the cross. And before the opening of the cave they
    rolled a great stone.</p>

    <p>And Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, and some other
    women, saw the tomb, and watched while they laid the body of
    Jesus in it. On the next morning, some of the rulers of the
    Jews came to Pilate, and said:</p>

    <p>"Sir, we remember that that man Jesus of Nazareth, who
    deceived the people, said while he was yet alive, 'After three
    days I will rise again.' Give orders that the tomb shall be
    watched and made sure for three days, or else his disciples may
    steal his body, and then say, 'He is risen <a name="Page_252"
       id="Page_252"></a>from the dead'; and thus even after his
       death he may do more harm than he did while he was
       alive."</p>

    <p>Pilate said to them:</p>

    <p>"Set a watch, and make it as sure as you can."</p>

    <p>Then they placed a seal upon the stone, so that no one might
    break it; and they set a watch of soldiers at the door.</p>

    <p>And in the tomb the body of Jesus lay from the evening of
    Friday, the day when he died on the cross, to the dawn of
    Sunday, the first day of the week, when he arose from the dead
    and appeared unto his disciples.</p>

    <p>But the brightest day in all the world was this Sunday
    morning. For on that day the stone was rolled away from the
    tomb and Jesus came forth from the dead to gladden his
    disciples. This he had told them he would do. On this Sunday
    morning, Mary Magdalene and another Mary, called Salome, came
    to the tomb, found the stone rolled away and an angel standing
    by the open tomb. He told them that Jesus was not there, but
    had risen.</p>

    <p>Afterward Jesus was with his disciples for forty days, after
    which he was taken up into heaven.<a name="Page_253"

       id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_MAN_AT_THE_BEAUTIFUL_GATE"></a>THE
       STORY OF THE MAN AT THE BEAUTIFUL GATE</h2>

    <p>Soon after Jesus was taken up into heaven, his disciples
    began to preach, as he had told them to do. They stood up in
    the streets, and in the Temple, and spoke to the people all the
    words that Jesus had given to them. And although they could no
    longer see Jesus, he was with them, and helped them, and gave
    them great power.</p>

    <p>The two apostles, Peter and John, were one day going up to
    the temple at the afternoon hour of prayer, about three
    o'clock. They walked across the court of the Gentiles, which
    was a large, open square paved with marble, having on its
    eastern side a double row of pillars with a roof above them,
    called Solomon's Porch. In front of this porch was the
    principal entrance to the Temple, through a gate which was
    called "The Beautiful Gate." In front of this gate they saw a
    lame man sitting. He was one who in all his life had never been
    able to walk; and as he was very poor, his friends carried him
    every day to this place; and there he sat, hoping that some of
    those who went into the Temple might take pity on him, and give
    him a little money.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_254"
       id="Page_254"></a>In front of this man Peter and John
       stopped; and Peter said: "Look at us!"</p>

    <p>The lame man looked earnestly on the two apostles, thinking
    they were about to give him something. But Peter said:</p>

    <p>"Silver and gold have I none; but what I have that I will
    give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk!"</p>

    <p>And Peter took hold of the lame man's right hand, and raised
    him up. At once the lame man felt a new power entering into his
    feet and ankle-bones. He leaped up, and stood upon his feet,
    and began to walk, as he had never done before in all his life.
    He walked up the steps with the two apostles, and went by their
    side into the Temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
    The people who now saw him leaping up and running knew him, for
    they had seen him every day sitting as a beggar at the
    Beautiful Gate: and every one was filled with wonder at the
    change which had come over him.</p>

    <p>After worshipping and praising God in the Temple, the man,
    still holding fast to Peter and John, went out with them
    through the Beautiful Gate, into Solomon's Porch. And in a very
    few minutes a great crowd of people were drawn together to the
    place to see the man who had been made well, and to see also
    the two men who had healed him.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_255"
       id="Page_255"></a>Then Peter stood up before the throng of
       people, and spoke to them:</p>

    <p>"Ye men of Israel," he said, "why do you look wondering on
    this man? or why do you fix your eyes upon us, as though by our
    own power or goodness we had made this man to walk? The God of
    Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has in this way shown the
    power and the glory of his Son Jesus, whom you gave up to his
    enemies, and whom you refused before Pontius Pilate, when
    Pilate was determined to set him free. But you refused the Holy
    One and the Righteous One, and chose a murderer, Barabbas, to
    be set free in his place; and you killed the Prince of Life,
    whom God raised from the dead. We who have seen him risen,
    declare that this is true. And the power of Jesus, through
    faith in his name, has made this man strong. Yes, it is faith
    in Christ that has given him this perfect soundness before you
    all. Now, my brothers, I am sure that you did not know that it
    was the Son of God and your own Saviour whom you sent to the
    cross. Therefore turn to God in sorrow for this great sin, and
    God will forgive you, and in his own time he will send again
    Jesus Christ. God, who has raised up his Son, is ready to bless
    you, and turn away every one of you from his sins."</p>

    <p>While Peter was speaking, the priests, and the captain of
    the Temple, and the rulers, came <a name="Page_256"
       id="Page_256"></a>upon them; for they were angry as they
       heard Peter speak these words. They laid hold of Peter and
       John, and put them into the guardroom for the night. But
       many of those who had heard Peter speaking believed on
       Jesus, and sought the Lord; and the number of the followers
       of Christ rose from three thousand to five thousand.</p>

    <p>On the next day the rulers came together; and Annas and
    Caiphas, the high priests, were there, and with them many of
    their friends. They brought Peter and John, and set them before
    the company. The lame man who had been healed was still by the
    side of the two apostles. The rulers asked them:</p>

    <p>"By what power, or through whom have you done this?"</p>

    <p>Then Peter spoke boldly:</p>

    <p>"Ye rulers of the people and elders, if you are asking us
    about the good deed done to this man who was so helpless, how
    it was that he was made well, I will tell you that by the name
    of Jesus of Nazareth whom you put to death on the cross, whom
    God raised from the dead; even by him this man stands here
    before you all strong and well. And there is no salvation
    except through Jesus Christ, for there is no other name under
    heaven given among men that can save us from our sins."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_257"
       id="Page_257"></a>When these rulers saw how bold and strong
       were the words of Peter and John, they wondered, especially
       as they knew that they were plain men, not learned in books,
       and not used to speaking. They remembered that they had seen
       these men among the followers of Jesus, and they felt that
       in some way Jesus had given them his power. And as the man
       who had been healed was standing beside them, they could say
       nothing to deny that a wonderful work had been done.</p>

    <p>The rulers sent Peter and John out of the council-room,
    while they talked together. They said to each other:</p>

    <p>"What shall we do to these men? We cannot deny that a
    wonderful work has been done by them, for every one knows it.
    But we must stop this from spreading any more among the people.
    Let us command them not to speak to any man about the name of
    Jesus; and let us tell them, that if they do speak, we will
    punish them."</p>

    <p>So they called the two apostles into the room again, and
    said to them: "We forbid you to speak about Jesus, and the
    power of his name, to any man. If you do not stop talking about
    Jesus, we will lay hands on you, and put you in prison, and
    will have you beaten."</p>

    <p>But Peter and John answered the rulers:<a name="Page_258"
       id="Page_258"></a> "Whether it is right to obey you or to
       obey God, you can judge. As for ourselves we cannot keep
       silent; we must speak of what we have seen and heard."</p>

    <p>The rulers were afraid to do any harm to Peter and John,
    because they knew that the people praised God for the good work
    that they had done; and they would be angry to have harm come
    to them. For fear of the people, they let them go. And being
    let go, they went to their own friends, the company who met in
    the upper room, and there they gave thanks to God for helping
    them to speak his word without fear.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_STEPHEN_THE_FIRST_MARTYR"
       id="THE_STORY_OF_STEPHEN_THE_FIRST_MARTYR"></a>THE STORY OF
       STEPHEN, THE FIRST MARTYR</h2>

    <p>In the New Testament, in the book of Acts, you will learn
    how the members of the church in Jerusalem gave their money
    freely to help the poor. This free giving led to trouble, as
    the church grew so fast; for some of the widows who were poor
    were passed by, and their friends made complaints to the
    apostles. The twelve apostles called the whole church together,
    and said:</p>

    <p>"It is not well that we should turn aside from preaching and
    teaching the word of God to sit at tables and give out money.
    But, brethren, choose from among yourselves seven good men; men
    who have the Spirit of God and are wise, and we will give this
    work to them; so that we can spend our time in prayer and in
    preaching the gospel."</p>

    <p>This plan was pleasing to all the church, and they chose
    seven men to take charge of the gifts of the people, and to see
    that they were sent to those who were in need. The first man
    chosen was Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Spirit of
    God; and with him was Philip and five other good men. These
    seven men they brought before <a name="Page_260"
       id="Page_260"></a>the apostles; and the apostles laid their
       hands on their heads, setting them apart for their work of
       caring for the poor.</p>

    <p>But Stephen did more than to look after the needy ones. He
    began to preach the gospel of Christ, and to preach with such
    power as made every one who heard him feel the truth. Stephen
    saw before any other man in the church saw, that the gospel of
    Christ was not for Jews only, but was for all men; that all men
    might be saved if they would believe in Jesus; and this great
    truth Stephen began to preach with all his power. Such
    preaching as this, that men who were not Jews might be saved by
    believing in Christ, made many of the Jews very angry. They
    called all the people who were not Jews "Gentiles," and they
    looked upon them with hate and scorn; but they could not answer
    the words that Stephen spoke. They roused up the people and the
    rulers, and set them against Stephen, and at last they seized
    Stephen, and brought him before the great council of the
    rulers. They said to the rulers:</p>

    <p>"This man is always speaking evil words against the Temple
    and against the law of Moses. We have heard him say that Jesus
    of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the laws
    that Moses gave to us!"</p>

    <p>This was partly true and partly false; but no
    <a name="Page_261"
       id="Page_261"></a>lie is so harmful as that which has a
       little truth with it. Then the high-priest said to
       Stephen:</p>

    <p>"Are these things so?"</p>

    <p>And as Stephen stood up to answer the high-priest, all fixed
    their eyes upon him; and they saw that his face was shining, as
    though it was the face of an angel. Then Stephen began to speak
    of the great things that God had done for his people Israel in
    the past; how he had called Abraham, their father, to go forth
    into a new land; how he had given them great men, as Joseph,
    and Moses, and the prophets. He showed them how the Israelites
    had not been faithful to God, who had given them such wonderful
    blessings.</p>

    <p>Then Stephen said:</p>

    <p>"You are a people with hard hearts and stiff necks, who will
    not obey the words of God and his Spirit. As your fathers did,
    so you do, also. Your fathers killed the prophets whom God sent
    to them; and you have slain Jesus, the Righteous One!"</p>

    <p>As they heard these things, they became so angry against
    Stephen, that they gnashed on him with their teeth, like wild
    beasts. But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up toward
    heaven with his shining face; and he saw the glory of God, and
    Jesus standing on God's right hand, and he said:</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_262"
       id="Page_262"></a>I see the heavens opened, and the Son of
       man standing on the right hand of God!"</p>

    <p>But they cried out with angry voices, and rushed upon him,
    and dragged him out of the council-room, and outside the wall
    of the city. And there they threw stones upon him to kill him,
    while Stephen was kneeling down among the falling stones, and
    praying:</p>

    <p>"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit! Lord, lay not this sin up
    against them!"</p>

    <p>And when he had said this, he fell asleep in death, the
    first to be slain for the gospel of Christ.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
